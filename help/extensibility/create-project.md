# Create an App Builder Project

Developers extending Adobe GenStudio for Performance Marketing's native capabilities launch Add-on development by creating an [Adobe App Builder](https://developer.adobe.com/app-builder/) Project.

>[!BEGINSHADEBOX]

**Prerequisites**
You must have access to App Builder and the [Adobe Developer Console](https://developer.adobe.com/developer-console/) to create a project for your app. See [Create a  Project on Developer Console](https://developer.adobe.com/app-builder/docs/getting_started/first_app#2-create-a-new-project-on-developer-console).

**To create a new Project from a template**:

1. Log in to [Adobe Developer Console](https://developer.adobe.com/developer-console/).

1. Use the IMS org switcher on the Console landing page in the upper right corner to select your IMS organization.

1. From _Quick Start_, click **[!UICONTROL Create new project]** and select **[!UICONTROL Create project from template]**. The _Create a New Project from Template_ panel opens.

1. Select _App Builder_ from template options.

If you do not see the **[!UICONTROL Create project from template]** option, confirm that you have selected the correct IMS org. Confirm that you have followed the process in [How to Get Access to App Builder](https://developer.adobe.com/app-builder/docs/overview/getting_access/). If your IMS org is correct, App Builder is not enabled. Please contact Adobe as described in [How to Get Access to App Builder](https://developer.adobe.com/app-builder/docs/overview/getting_access/).

You are now ready to [develop your app](create-app.md).
