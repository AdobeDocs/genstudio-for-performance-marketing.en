# Distribute your app

_Distribution_ of an extension in the Adobe ecosystem is the process of making your extension available as an application on [Adobe Exchange](https://exchange.adobe.com/) for either public or private distribution.

The application distribution process is described in detail in [App Builder app](https://developer.adobe.com/developer-distribution/experience-cloud/docs/guides/submission/app_builder_submission/).

>[!NOTE]
>
>Create an App Builder Project and App Builder App before creating a listing for distribution. You must have both a deployed app and packaged version of your extension.

## Distribution overview

* **Create a listing on Adobe Developer Distribution for your app**. [Adobe Developer Distribution](https://developer.adobe.com/developer-distribution/) is a self-service submission portal for developers to publish their listings on Adobe Exchange. Creating a listing includes assigning informative public details about your extension, including name, payment, and support information.

* **Submit the application listing for approval**. After you have added listing details for your application, you can upload the package and submit the listing for approval. If you change your application listing details after submitting the application for review, you must re-submit for approval.

Once your application has been approved, users can download and install your extension.

## Create a listing

**To create a listing**

1. From [Adobe Developer Console](https://developer-stage.adobe.com/console), select your extension name in the _Product & services_ area.

1. Click **[!UICONTROL Create a new listing]**. The _New listing_ page for your extension opens.

1. In the _Application information_  area, enter informative details about your application. Details include the public name of your application, descriptive text, and payment and support information.

1. Add a new version number for your application.

Once you have completed adding relevant details, you can upload your extension package and submit it for approval.

## Submit the extension for approval
 
1. From the _New listing_ page, upload an `app.zip` file of the packaged AIO code to the listing. See Package the AIO app.

1. Click **[!UICONTROL Preview and submit]**. The console displays either a success message or an informative message that identifies needed action.

After an Adobe administrator reviews and approves your extension, the extensible application is available for [installation](install.md).
