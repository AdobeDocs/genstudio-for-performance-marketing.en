# Distribute your app

Distributing your app makes it available to members in your organization.

Before distributing your Add-on, confirm that your App Builder app is deployed in an App Builder Project. You also need developer permissions in the org from which you submit the app for approval and system administrator permissions to approve the app.

**To distribute your app**:

1. From the [Adobe Developer Console](https://developer.adobe.com/console/), select the org, Project, and workspace where the app is deployed.

1. Select **[!UICONTROL Approval]** from the _Workspace overview_ area. The _App Approval_ pane opens. 

1. In the _App Submissions Details_ area, add informative details about your Add-on. Details include app name, description, and contact email. 

1. When you have completed all fields, click **[!UICONTROL Submit]**. 

1. Log in to [Adobe Exchange](https://exchange.adobe.com/) using the same Adobe ID that you used to log into Developer Console. If you do not have system administrator permissions in this org, request approval from an org system administrator. 

1. Select **[!UICONTROL Manage]** > **[!UICONTROL App Builder applications]** to access a request to review the app. 

1. After reviewing the app, select **[!UICONTROL Approve]**. Optionally, add informative notes.

Your Add-on is now visible in your organization's GenStudio for Performance Marketing instance.
