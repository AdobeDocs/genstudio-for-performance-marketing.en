# Install your app

Installation for both private and public apps requires listing on [Adobe Exchange](https://exchange.adobe.com/), a portal that lists and provides access to approved extensions for Adobe Experience Cloud applications. Only [distributed extensions](distribute.md) can be installed.

>[!NOTE]
>
>Your application must undergo the distribution process and been approved by an Adobe administrator before you can install it.

**To install your app**:

1. Navigate to Adobe Exchange. You can access the extension from either the staging landing page (https://stage.exchange.adobe.com/ ) or the production landing page (https://stage.exchange.adobe.com/# ).

1.  Select your application from the list of available extensions. Clicking on the extension name opens a view of the extension details. 

1. Click the **[!UICONTROL Free]** button at the top right of the _Extensions listings_ page.

1. Click the **[!UICONTROL Yes, continue button]** on the  _Application requires additional product_ popup. The popup indicates that the extension is ready for approval by your organization's system manager for installation.

1. Click **[!UICONTROL Manage your app]** to continue installation. Adobe Exchange adds the app to the list of applications, but you cannot install or use the extension until your system manger approves. Clicking this button alerts your system manager that their approval is required. 

After the system manager has approved the extension, Adobe Exchange lists the extension as an approved app. If this is a private extension, installation is complete.

**To complete installation for a public extension**:

To install a public extension, perform this additional step:

1. Click on the extension name  in the _Extensions listings_ page. The _Add new environment_ popup prompts you to enter the type of environment in which you want to deploy the extension.

1. Enter an environment name, then click **[!UICONTROL Save environment]**.

1. Select _Deploy_ from the more options (...) menu.

After a brief interval, your app is available in the Adobe Exchange listing.
