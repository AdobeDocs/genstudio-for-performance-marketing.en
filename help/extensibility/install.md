# Install your app

Installation for both private and public apps requires listing on [Adobe Exchange](https://exchange.adobe.com/), a portal that lists and provides access to approved add-ons for Adobe Experience Cloud applications. Only [distributed add-ons](distribute.md) can be installed.

>[!NOTE]
>
>Your public add-on must undergo the distribution process and be approved by an Adobe administrator before installation.

**To install your app**:

1. Navigate to Adobe Exchange. You can access the add-on from the production landing page.

1. Select your application from the list of available apps. Clicking on the add-on name opens a view of the add-on details. 

1. Click the **[!UICONTROL Free]** button at the top right of the _Extensions listings_ page.

1. Click the **[!UICONTROL Yes, continue button]** on the Application requires additional product_ popup. The popup indicates that the add-on is ready for approval by your organization's system manager for installation.

1. Click **[!UICONTROL Manage your app]** to continue installation. Adobe Exchange adds the app to the list of applications, but you cannot install or use the add-on until your system manager approves. Clicking this button alerts your system manager that their approval is required. 

After the system manager has approved the add-on, Adobe Exchange lists the add-on as an approved app. Private add-on installation is now complete.

**To complete installation for a public app**:

To install a public add-on, perform this additional step:

1. Click on the add-on name in the _Extensions listings_ page. The _Add new environment_ popup prompts you to enter the type of environment in which you want to deploy the add-on.

1. Enter an environment name, then click **[!UICONTROL Save environment]**.

1. Select _Deploy_ from the more options (...) menu.

After a brief interval, your app is available in the Adobe Exchange listing.
