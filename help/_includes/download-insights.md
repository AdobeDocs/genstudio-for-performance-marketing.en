Click the download (arrow pointing down) icon above the right side of the table to download a CSV file based on the viewable table. The download automatically begins and places the CSV file in your default download location. Some tables may have multiple pages, which you can see below the right side of the table. The CSV file includes data from _all_ pages of the table.
