### Approval templates

Workfront Proof approval templates, also known as proof or automated workflow templates, streamline the review and approval process by providing preformatted workflow steps that can be quickly applied to a proof. These templates include predefined reviewers, approvers, proof roles, email alerts, and deadlines, ensuring consistency and efficiency. Users can select from a set of predefined templates to automatically apply the appropriate approval chain, supporting both single-phase and multi-phase approval processes. Each stage of the workflow automatically associates the relevant reviewers, and all status updates and comments from the Workfront Proof workflow are visible within the Project Execution Module (PEM), enhancing transparency and collaboration.

### Version control

Workfront Proof enables digital review and approval of content through an interactive proof viewer, where each submission in the workflow represents a distinct version of the content. These versions are saved and can be compared side-by-side, allowing stakeholders to track changes and provide feedback efficiently. The system maintains a persistent history of all comments, decisions, and versions, supporting audit and compliance needs. Each version supports multi-stage, role-based approval workflows, with all approvals and rejections logged and timestamped. This structured versioning ensures transparency, accountability, and streamlined collaboration throughout the content lifecycle.
