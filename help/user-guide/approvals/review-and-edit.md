# Review and edit content

The review and approval stage often involves multiple stakeholders and iterative feedback, which can slow down content production. GenStudio for Performance Marketing streamlines this process with generative AI that accelerates content revisions, enabling creators to respond quickly to feedback using prompt-based edits. The more complex the review cycle, the greater the time-saving benefits GenStudio delivers.

## Iterative draft editing

Content editors can make in-process edits to content in response to review comments. While a draft is under revision, approvers can continue adding review comments but cannot change asset status. The content editor can continue editing content on the Canvas while approvers continue their reviews.

## View approval requests

As a designated approver, you can access the content that you are asked to review and approve in several ways:

* **Access the draft for review directly from the draft link in the approval request**. Click the draft link in either the approval request email notification or in-product notification. The Canvas opens, displaying the asset or experience. The _Approval_ panel is displayed on the right.

* **Access the draft for review from the list of approval requests**. If you are asked to review multiple content drafts, your notification email includes a **[!UICONTROL View all notifications]** button. Click this button to navigate to a page that displays all the notifications that you have received, including approval requests and notifications that you have enabled from other Adobe Experience Cloud products.

## Access content for review

You can approve content if you have received an email requesting your review and approval of an asset or experience. This email contains a link to the read-only draft that you have been asked to review. This URL is valid only while the draft is under review.

**To review content**:

1. Use the link in your in-production notification or email to navigate to the content for review.

   The Canvas opens, displaying the content for review.

1. Click the **[!UICONTROL Review & Approve]** button on the upper right.1. 

   The _Approvals_ panel for this asset opens.

## Request changes

You can list suggested changes or ask questions about the draft from the _Approval_ panel. The **Needs work** draft status notifies the content creator that changes are requested.

This process of reviewing, suggesting edits to the content creator, and then revising the content and optionally requesting additional input via `@mention` comments is highly iterative. It is in this part of the cycle that you see the time-saving abilities of GenStudio for Performance Marketing.

**To request changes**:

1. Set draft status to **Needs work**.

1. Enter comments and recommended changes in the **Comments** field and click **[!UICONTROL Submit]**.

   All reviewers and the content creator can view these comments.

1. Click **[!UICONTROL Review & Approve]** and assign **Needs work**. 

   This triggers email and in-product notifications to the content creator.

The content creator can continue their edits while receiving and responding to incoming review comments.

## Manage approvals

Content creator sees a **[!UICONTROL Manage approvals]** button on their draft Canvas. Use this button to remove or add approvers throughout the review and approval process.

See [Request review and approval](./request-review.md).

## Review content with Workfront Proof

Proofing Viewer stores review comments with each version of a proof, or content draft. You can compare two versions of proof. Proof Viewer provides a robust markup tool for annotating proofs. See [Comment on a proof](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/en/docs/workfront/using/review-and-approve-work/proofing/review-proofs-in-workfront/comment-on-a-proof/comment-on-proof-1).

**To review content**:

1. Click the review URL in your email or in-product notification.

   GenStudio for Performance Marketing loads the Proofing Viewer _My new approval_ view, which displays the proof for review.

1. Click **[!UICONTROL Add comment]**.
   
   The _Add comment_ popup opens.

1. Enter a comment in the **[!UICONTROL Add comment]** field.

1. Click **[!UICONTROL Post]**.

   The content creator is notified of your comments.

### Compare proofs

From Proofing Viewer, you can [compare proof versions](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/en/docs/workfront/using/workfront-proof/work-with-proofs-in-wf-proof/review-proofs-web-proofing-viewer/compare-proofs).

**To compare proofs**:

1. Click the name of the proof in the upper-left corner of Proofing Viewer. 

1. Click the _Compare_ icon next to a proof version.

   Proofs display side by side, with the newer version on the left side.
