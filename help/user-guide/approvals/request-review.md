# Request review and approval

Ready to invite your coworkers to review an asset or experience that you created? You can invite stakeholders to contribute feedback on a draft of your content with the eventual goal of approval. OnlyÂ designated approvers can approve content, but all reviewers can add and access review comments.

If you have created an asset or experience, you can ask others in your organization's approval chain to review and comment on your work. Although any GenStudio for Performance Marketing organization member can review a draft, only designated approvers can comment on or approve a draft.

## Launch an approval request

After you generate an asset or experience, you can request its review and approval.

**To request a review**:

1. Click the **[!UICONTROL Send for approval]** button on the top menu bar of the Canvas. 

   The _Send for approval_ pop-up opens and identifies the draft for which you are requesting a review. If you generate multiple variants, the entire Canvas is sent for review.

1. (Optional) Select the _Title_ field to change the draft title if needed. Draft titles should be descriptive, informative, and focus on the review objective. 
 
   Changing the title here also changes the underlying draft experience title.

1. Select approvers and reviewers. As you begin typing, the **[!UICONTROL Approver]** field auto-completes the approver user name from the list of users with GenStudio for Performance Marketing view and approve permissions. 

   The **[!UICONTROL Send]** button is enabled after you have entered at least one approver name.

1. (Optional) Use comments to communicate additional context about the assets under review and call attention to specific details and callouts. Use `@mentions` to tag collaborators and notify them of specific feedback.

1. Click **[!UICONTROL Send]**. 

   In-product and email notifications alert each designated approver that they have content to review.

## Approval panel

The _Approval_ panel provides current status information about the review workflow as soon as you launch an approval request. From this panel, you can:

* Add or remove review participants.
* Add or change a message for reviewers.
* Edit the review title.
* Change the optional due date.

If the Workfront Proof integration is enabled, this panel shows the status of each approval stage in multistage workflows. To view comments, click **[!UICONTROL View comments in Workfront]** to open them in the [!DNL Proofing Viewer].

## Launch an approval request with Workfront Proof

Workfront Proof provides content editors with two primary options for initiating a review:

* **Manual invitations**: Invite individual approvers and reviewers directly to participate in the proofing process. This method offers flexibility when working on one-off reviews.

* **Proof approval templates**: Use predefined templates that include a set list of reviewers and, optionally, structured approval stages. These templates are created and managed by your Workfront Proof administrator within a designated Workfront project. Templates help standardize the review process and ensure consistency across teams and content types.

**To launch a review cycle by manually inviting participants**:

1. Click **[!UICONTROL Request approval]** from the Canvas. 
   
   The _Request approval_ popup opens.

1. (Optional) Add a title for your review request in the **[!UICONTROL Title]** field.

1. Select **[!UICONTROL Invite people]**.
     
1. Enter either participant user name or email address in the **[!UICONTROL Add names or emails]** field. 
   
   Organization member names pop up as options as you enter text.

1. Select a participant name, then select their role: approver or reviewer. By default, participants are assigned the approver role. 

1. (Optional) Under **[!UICONTROL Settings]**, assign a due date for a review decision. This date is not enforced, but reminds reviewers of the expected time frame. 

1. (Optional) Add an informative message that provides context for reviewers.

1. Click **[!UICONTROL Send]** when you are ready to launch the approval request.
   
   All review participants are notified by email that they have been assigned a review task. 
   
**To launch a review using an approval template**:

1. Click **[!UICONTROL Request approval]** from the Canvas. 
   
   The _Request approval_ popup opens. 

1. (Optional) Add a title for your review request in the **[!UICONTROL Title]** field.

1. Select a Workfront Proof project from the **[!UICONTROL Project]** drop-down menu.

1. Select a template from the **[!UICONTROL Use template]** drop-down menu.
   
   The _Request approval_ popup opens, displaying pre-determined participants and review stages. Workfront Proof administrators create approval templates and assign them to Workfront projects. The project you select determines both your template options and the fields displayed in the _Request approval_ popup.

1. (Optional) You can edit the template for use in this particular approval workflow. 

1. (Optional) Under **[!UICONTROL Settings]**, assign a due date for a review decision. This date is not enforced, but reminds reviewers of the expected time frame. 

1. (Optional) Add an informative message that provides context for reviewers. Use `@mentions` to tag collaborators and notify them of specific feedback.

1. Click **[!UICONTROL Send]** when you are ready to launch the approval request.

## Access review comments

* Click **[!UICONTROL View comments in Workfront]**.
   
  [!DNL Proofing Viewer] displays the proof with all comments listed to the right of the proof content. If there are multiple comments, you can navigate the list by clicking the navigation arrows at the top right. Click a comment to navigate to the relevant section of the proof.

## Request new approval

Review-and-approval cycles are iterative. Reviewers suggest changes, and content creators revise based on feedback. Reviewers may then request another review before the content moves to final approval and sign-off. 

**To request a new approval**:

1. Click the **[!UICONTROL Request new approval]** button on the upper right of the Canvas. 
   
   The _Request new approval_ popup opens, displaying the same fields as the _Request approval_ popup. The status of each stage is displayed (pending or not yet started).

1. (Optional) Invite new reviewers or delete currently assigned ones.

1. (Optional) Under _Settings_, edit the due date or add a message.

1. Click **[!UICONTROL Send]**.

   In-product and email notifications alert each designated approver that they have content to review.
