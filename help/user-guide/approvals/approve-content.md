# Approve content

Approvers receive in-product notifications, email, and if enabled, Slack notifications when their review and approval is needed. Notifications provide a link to the Canvas that displays the content under review. See [Account preferences and notifications](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/en/docs/core-services/interface/features/account-preferences) for information about managing your notifications.

If the content draft meets your organization's standards and your expectations, you are ready to approve the draft.

**To approve a draft**:

1. Access the draft from either the in-product notification or by clicking the notification email's **[!UICONTROL View all notifications]** button to navigate to the draft.

1. (Optional) Enter comments in the **[!UICONTROL Comments]** text field.

1. Select **[!UICONTROL Approved]**.

## Approve content in Proofing Viewer

If you are a designated approver, [!DNL Proofing Viewer] displays the **[!UICONTROL Make a decision]** button.

**To make a decision about content**:

1. Click **[!UICONTROL Make a decision]** at the top of [!DNL Proofing Viewer].

   The _Proof decision_ popup opens, displaying options for approving or sending feedback.

1. Select **[!UICONTROL Approved]** or **[!UICONTROL Approved with changes]**.

1. Click **[!UICONTROL Submit]**.

The draft creator is notified of your approval, and your work is done. See [Publish content](/help/user-guide/approvals/publish-content.md) for an overview of the process of saving to [!DNL Content], or _publishing_.
