## LLMs

GenStudio for Performance Marketing leverages Firefall, Adobe's generative AI platform, which offers foundational AI and machine learning (ML) services.

* **OpenAI and HuggingFace**—Incorporated for their versatility and robust support for LLMs and embeddings, crucial for managing and deploying these models effectively.

## Data governance

When working with AI to generate content, it is essential to ensure the output is safe and inclusive for all users. This requires evaluation of the content for potential harmful biases, hate speech, offensive material, or profanity. Thorough testing from multiple perspectives, a comprehensive ethics review, and implementing effective mitigation plans is important to prevent harmful content from emerging in outputs.

This approach reinforces social responsibility, minimizes reputational risk, and ensures adherence to Adobe's Trust & Safety and Ethics policies.

GenStudio for Performance Marketing incorporates mitigation plans to prevent the use of identified harmful or biased content per data governance standards and policies. When such content is detected, you are made aware that asset generation is blocked with a "Can't generate" message.

When this message appears, you can edit the prompt and try again _or_ flag the prompt content for review by GenStudio for Performance Marketing. The prompt data for content that is flagged for review is collected for internal review purposes. 

## Content lifecycle

The demand is high for quality experiences in multiple channels at a faster pace. GenStudio for Performance Marketing simplifies the content supply chain into a well-organized workflow for marketers. GenStudio for Performance Marketing leverages Adobe technology at each stage of the lifecycle.
