## Data governance

When working with AI to generate content, it is essential to ensure the output is safe and inclusive for all users. This requires evaluation of the content for potential harmful biases, hate speech, offensive material, or profanity. Adobe thoroughly tests content generation technology from multiple perspectives, performs comprehensive ethics reviews, and implements effective mitigation plans to prevent harmful content from emerging in outputs.

This approach reinforces social responsibility, minimizes reputational risk, and ensures adherence to [Adobe's Trust & Safety and Ethics policies](https://www.adobe.com/content/dam/cc/en/ai-ethics/pdfs/Adobe-AI-Ethics-Principles.pdf).

GenStudio for Performance Marketing incorporates mitigation plans to prevent the use of identified harmful or biased content per Adobe data governance standards and policies. When such content is detected, you are made aware that asset generation is blocked with a "Can't generate" message.

When this message appears, you can edit the prompt and try again _or_ flag the prompt content for review by GenStudio for Performance Marketing. The prompt data for content that is flagged for review is collected for internal review purposes. 

## Content lifecycle

The demand is high for quality experiences in multiple channels at a faster pace. GenStudio for Performance Marketing simplifies the content supply chain into a well-organized workflow for marketers. GenStudio for Performance Marketing leverages Adobe technology at each stage of the lifecycle.
