# Best practices for using templates

Templates significantly reduce the time and effort required to generate new content by providing a starting point that includes pre-configured layouts and design elements.

You can learn about basic template elements and procedures in [Work with Templates](use-templates.md). And deep-dive into building templates in [Customize a template](customize-template.md).

Use the following recommendations when using templates with GenStudio for Performance Marketing.

## Configure channel guidelines

Configure [channel guidelines](../guidelines/brands.md#channel-guidelines) for each brand before using templates in GenStudio for Performance Marketing. The channel guidelines directly influence the type of content generated when using the template. For example, you can set character limits on the body of an email.
