# Provision Adobe GenStudio for Performance Marketing

Product provisioning is the one-time setup of your organization's GenStudio for Performance Marketing instance. An Adobe system administrator performs these initial provisioning tasks in the Adobe Admin Console. From the Admin Console, an Adobe system admin can access the GenStudio product profile and assign available product licenses to users.

>[!NOTE]
>Only Adobe system admins can carry out enablement tasks that require Adobe Admin Console access.

## Step 1: Access the GenStudio product profile in the Adobe Admin Console

 Within the Admin console, the GenStudio product profile defines rules and user profiles that are unique to brand and campaign creation and management within GenStudio for Performance Marketing.

**To access the GenStudio product profile**

1. Click the **Get started** link in your welcome email to navigate to the [Adobe Admin Console](https://helpx.adobe.com/enterprise/using/admin-console.html#Overview).

1. Log in to the Admin Console using your Adobe ID.

   Upon successful login, you see the _Overview_ tab of the Adobe Admin Console.

1. Navigate to the _Products_ tab. This tab displays all the Adobe products your organization has purchased.

1. Select **[!UICONTROL GenStudio]** from the list of products. The Console displays the GenStudio product profile, which displays key information about the product licenses your organization has purchased. It also provides options to manage these licenses.

You are now ready to assign licenses to, or provision, users to GenStudio for Performance Marketing. If you have logged into the wrong organization, switch to the correct organization before trying to assign entitlements to users. To change your organization, click the organization name from the top right corner and choose the **GenStudio** organization.

## Step 2: Provision users

Provisioning users in the Admin Console is the process of assigning product licenses to users. These users must belong to the IMS org that is specified in the product profile. You can provision users to your GenStudio for Performance Marketing organization in the same way you provision users to other Adobe products. You can add users manually or import users in bulk.

>[!NOTE]
>You must assign yourself GenStudio system manager entitlements to perform system management tasks in GenStudio for Performance Marketing.

**Prerequisites**:

Prepare for provisioning by first identifying this basic information about the users you want to add:

* First and last name
* Corporate email address
* Type of entitlements you want to assign user. See [Adobe GenStudio for Performance Marketing user roles](user-roles.md) to better understand the three available user roles.

Once you have onboarded users to your organization's deployment of GenStudio for Performance Marketing, a Genstudio system manager can [set up your organization's brand and media guidelines](get-started.md).
