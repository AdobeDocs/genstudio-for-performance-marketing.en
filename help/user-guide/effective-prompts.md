# Write effective prompts

Communicating with the generative AI is essential to working effectively in Adobe GenStudio for Performance Marketing.

GenStudio for Performance Marketing provides a generative AI prompt each time there is an opportunity to modify an asset. The components of an effective prompt should include descriptive language, examples, and information not provided through your configured guidelines.

As a best practice, supply GenStudio for Performance Marketing with your brand information using [guidelines](/help/user-guide/guidelines/overview.md), then you can fully leverage the generative AI to produce brand-aligned content experiences.

## Descriptive language

You can use natural language to articulate your ideas to create experiences. Your prompt guides the AI to generate channel content that is personalized and images that complement your vision. The more details that you provide, the greater the chance of producing an image or an experience that meets your needs. Use clear and descriptive language to provide as much detail as possible:

- For **images**, use words that describe ambiance, mood, color, composition, and style.
- For **copy**, use words that describe the audience, purpose, new feature descriptions, examples, and actions.

The following is a sample prompt that articulates information about your intent, target audience, and style.

```bash
Write an email to motivate infrequent users of Photoshop to follow an in-app tutorial that teaches them to combine elements of two photos into a beautiful work of art. Highlight the generative AI capabilities of Photoshop and use references to natural imagery.
```

## Prompt criteria

In GenStudio for Performance Marketing [[!DNL Create]](/help/user-guide/create/overview.md), you can use **[!UICONTROL Prompt criteria]** ([_Parameters_](/help/user-guide/create/overview.md#parameters) and a prompt) in the prompt drawer to add details through selection to improve the AI interpretation.

For [emails](/help/user-guide/create/email-experiences.md), the prompt criteria might include adding [guidelines](/help/user-guide/guidelines/overview.md) in _Parameters_, upload of an asset to use in the email variants, and a descriptive prompt. For a [Meta ad](/help/user-guide/create/create-meta-ad.md), the prompt criteria might include a brand guideline in _Parameters_, selection or upload of an existing asset, settings related to images or assets such as aspect ratio, and a prompt. The real power begins with [configuring guidelines](/help/user-guide/guidelines/add-guidelines.md).

>[!NOTE]
>
>If guidelines are added in _Parameters_ in the prompt drawer, you do not need to include reference to them in your prompt. GenStudio for Performance Marketing leverages those [!DNL Brands], [!DNL Products], and [!DNL Personas] in content generation.

### Guidelines

GenStudio for Performance Marketing guidelines help the generative AI to personalize your asset composition. When presented with prompt criteria, you can choose a [[!DNL Brand]](/help/user-guide/guidelines/brands.md), a [[!DNL Persona]](/help/user-guide/guidelines/personas.md), and a [[!DNL Product]](/help/user-guide/guidelines/products.md) from your configured guidelines.

>[!TIP]
>
>You control how and when GenStudio for Performance Marketing uses your [!DNL Brand] guidelines. See [Guidelines](/help/user-guide/guidelines/overview.md) to learn how to configure and manage your brand guidelines.

### Structured prompts

For multi-section emails, you can structure prompts to provide section-specific instructions to generate varying content for each section in an email. Structured prompts should directly reference [section names in the email template](/help/user-guide/content/customize-template.md#sections-or-groups) so that the generated content can be inserted into the corresponding content placeholders.

For instance, you can instruct GenStudio for Performance Marketing to generate content for an email that promotes a new product in the first section and details the cost-saving benefits in the second section.

The structured prompt should:

- Use one of the following references to the section name in the email template:
  - Pod
  - Group
  - Section
  - Module

  For instance, if your template uses `moduleA` or `Group-3` as a section name, then you can reference those section names in the prompt.

- Follow the recommended rules/structure. If the prompt structure does not adhere to the provided format, the prompt applies to *all* email sections and still facilitates content generation.
- Use section names as defined in your email template. Prompt references must match the section names coded in your email template.
- Be case insensitive. For instance, you can use `Pod` or `pod` in your email template and structured prompt.
- Reference the generic user prompt first, and then the section-specific directives.
- Use a colon, hyphen, comma, or other demarcation (`,:;#$!~|@=-%&*^_`) as a separation between the section name reference and directive. For instance, you can use the following as a section-specific prompt directive: `Pod1; Describe how to easily edit text and swap images.`

The following is a sample prompt that articulates the recommended prompt structure and leverages an email template that uses the identifying term `Pod` as in `Pod1`, `Pod2`, and `Pod3`.

```properties
Create an exciting multi-pod email focusing on Creative Cloud and its powerful generative AI capabilities.

Encourage customers to convert to Photoshop or use a free Photoshop trial. We want to better educate them about app features.

Pod1: Focus on Adobe Photoshop and its new generative AI tools that enable creators to bring images to life in minutes.

Pod2: Focus on Adobe Illustrator and its new generative AI tools, such as Generative Shape Fill, which allows you to quickly fill your vector outline and explore a variety of options that match the look and feel of your own artwork.

Pod3: Focus on Adobe Acrobat Pro. Make users aware that with Acrobat Pro they can edit images and text inside a PDF.
```

## Try again

Prompting is an iterative process. If the results are not meeting your expectations, review your prompt and make some changes or add more details. Or, you can paste in sections from a campaign brief. You can even request that GenStudio for Performance Marketing avoid certain words, elements, or themes.

## Best practices

Some simple best practices for crafting effective prompts:

- Be specific and provide details about what to do and not do.
- Provide context using external references.
- Leverage GenStudio for Performance Marketing guidelines.
- Review and adjust guidelines regularly.
- Iterate and refine.
- Learn through experimentation.
