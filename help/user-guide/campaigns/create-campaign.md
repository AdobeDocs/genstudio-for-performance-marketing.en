This label identifies the campaign throughout GenStudio for Performance Marketing, including its storage in [!DNL Content].

GenStudio system managers or Genstudio editors can create a campaign.

## Step 1: Define campaign basics

The campaign and its attributes are identified throughout [!DNL Content] by a campaign label. Associating a campaign label with an asset or experience links that content to the specific campaign. Assets and experiences can be assigned to multiple campaigns.

## Step 2: Assign channels and regions

Channel and region settings specify where the campaign is deployed and identify its distribution channels.

Channel settings define the public distribution channels for your campaign, including social media platforms, email marketing services, and display ad networks. GenStudio for Performance Marketing analyzes data from these channels about your active campaigns, assets, and experiences. [!DNL Insights] then processes this data to provide channel-specific performance analysis.

Region settings define the geographical areas where your campaign is deployed. Connecting regional data sources helps tailor campaign content and strategy to the preferences and behaviors of audiences in different locations. It also supports more precise targeting and performance analysis based on regional metrics.

Record types are predefined templates that represent different entities or objects within a system. Channels, regions, personas, and products are record types within GenStudio for Performance Marketing. When you create a campaign, you associate personas, regions, products, and channel records to the campaign.

**To select distribution channels for your campaign**:

   The _Select Channels_ popup opens.

1. Select the channels where the campaign is deployed. Valid values include `Email`, `Paid media`, `Web`, and `Display ads`.

   Optionally, choose **[!UICONTROL See all]** to open a view of all supported regions.

## Step 3: Associate personas and products

GenStudio for Performance Marketing saves persistent models of personas and products as records. A Persona record, for example, defines the characteristics of a customer segmentâ€”your generated content's target audience. It can include information about demographics and history of customer interactions. The personas that are available in the drop-down list are defined on an organization level by your organization's personas guidelines.

## Step 5: Add content to your campaign

GenStudio for Performance Marketing associates content with a campaign through the campaign label, which is saved in content metadata. Content can belong to multiple campaigns.

**To add content from [!DNL Content]**
