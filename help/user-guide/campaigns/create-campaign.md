# Create a [!DNL Campaign]

The Adobe GenStudio for Performance Marketing [!DNL Campaigns] feature accelerates the development and deployment of marketing initiatives, or _campaigns_. The [!DNL Campaigns] workflow coordinates the development and deployment of campaign assets that lend themselves to creation and management by AI-generated workflows, including brand-compliant images and text. [!DNL Campaigns] also provides transparency into campaign goals, brand-aligned content, and designated channels.

A GenStudio for Performance Marketing [!DNL Campaigns] brief describes the essential aspects of a campaign as defined by the [!DNL Campaign] creator. [!DNL Campaign] stakeholders use this brief to create and evaluate content. Campaign briefs are dynamic. They change as individual stages of a campaign are deployed and as marketers evaluate the success of each stage.

GenStudio system manager or Genstudio editors use the [!DNL Campaigns] workflow to create a marketing campaign that identifies these key aspects of a marketing campaign:

Approved assets and experiences
Scheduling milestones

that defines campaign components for all stakeholders who are involved in the creation, review, approval, and deployment of [!DNL Campaign] assets. The campaign brief is captured as a uniquely named campaign in PEM 

GenStudio system manager or Genstudio editors define the key elements of your campaign brief in a [!DNL Campaigns] object. This [!DNL Campaigns] object creates a shared context for the campaign assets and experiences that are labeled with the same unique [!DNL Campaigns] label.

## Define campaign details

_Details_ in this workflow are the mandatory fields that you must complete to create a campaign. The information you enter in these fields is saved as  metadata attributes for the campaign in Content. These details both uniquely define the campaign and enhance its visibility within your organization.

Campaign metadata labels are used to organize GenStudio for Performance Marketing assets and experiences. Content with the same campaign metadata share a context.

### Name your campaign

Name your campaign by double-clicking the New campaign name header and entering an informative, unique campaign name. This name is available as a campaign label throughout the PEM workflows as a _campaign label_. You can use this campaign label to include an asset or experience in a specific campaign during asset upload and creation.

This table identifies the basic mandatory fields that you must enter information into the Details fields.

### Campaign labels

Campaign labels are tags that editors and system managers can apply to campaign assets and experiences to associate them with a specific marketing campaign. Labels identify the name of the campaign assigned during creation in GenStudio for Performance Marketing. Labels simplify managing and tracking assets and experiences by campaign in [!DNL Content] and Insights.

Campaign labels are saved in [!DNL Content] as part of the asset or experience's metadata. Assets and experiences with the same campaign metadata share a campaign context. Assets can be used in multiple campaigns.

When you assign an asset or experience to a campaign, GenStudio for Performance Marketing automatically assigns a campaign label to that content. When you access that asset or experience's details from any place in the PEM UI, you can see that campaign label.
