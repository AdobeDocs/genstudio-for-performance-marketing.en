# Create a [!DNL Campaign]

The [!DNL Campaigns] workflow enhances the development of campaign assets that lend themselves to creation and management by AI-generated workflows, including brand-compliant images and text. It also provides transparency into campaign goals, brand-aligned content, and designated channels.
