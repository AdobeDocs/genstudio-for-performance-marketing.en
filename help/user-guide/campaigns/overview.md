# Adobe GenStudio for Performance Marketing Campaigns

GenStudio for Performance Marketing [!DNL Campaigns] accelerates the development and deployment of marketing initiatives, or _campaigns_. [!DNL Campaigns] components include the assets and experiences that lend themselves to creation, approval, and management by GenStudio for Performance Marketing's AI-generated workflows, including brand-compliant images and text.

The [!DNL Campaigns] workflow provides: 

* Transparency into campaign goals, brand-aligned content, and designated channels

* Coordination of all assets and experiences that are created or imported into GenStudio for Performance Marketing

* Centralized view of all your organization's campaigns from the [!DNL Campaigns] timeline view.

## How Campaigns coordinates other GenStudio for Performance Marketing features

[!DNL Campaigns] orchestrates GenStudio for Performance Marketing generative AI-based capabilities to assist users in planning, creating, coordinating, and measuring campaign performance.

* [!DNL Create] provides generative AI-based tools for creating brand-aligned campaign assets. The process of creating new experiences, assets, and asset variants is centralized in the [!DNL Created] Canvas. Your organization's [!DNL Brand] guidelines inform content creation, which from the start of the creation process guides the underlying LLM to conform with your organization's expectations for this campaign. 

* Campaigns coordinate approved experiences, and [!DNL Content] provides a library of approved assets and experiences that can be included in campaigns. Content is typically generated in GenStudio, moves through the review and approval process, and then is saved in [!DNL Content].

* [!DNL Review and approvals] provides the structure for collaborative review and approval of individual assets and experiences. Stakeholders with different interest in and involvement in campaign asset creation -- from creatives to legal reviewers -- can participate in the process of refining campaign assets.

* [!DNL Insights] captures performance metrics for individual campaign elements and entire campaigns. Marketers can set up metrics to evaluate the campaign's success, such as click-through rates, conversion rates, and engagement levels. Stakeholders can use these metrics to assess the performance of these campaign elements. These insights can fuel creative reworking of assets in [!DNL Create].

* [!DNL Activate] supports publication of campaign assets to their designated channels.
