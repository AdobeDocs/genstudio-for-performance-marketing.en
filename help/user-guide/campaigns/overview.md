# Adobe GenStudio for Performance Marketing Campaigns

GenStudio for Performance Marketing [!DNL Campaigns] accelerates the development and deployment of marketing initiatives, or _campaigns_. [!DNL Campaigns] components include the assets and experiences that lend themselves to creation, approval, and management by GenStudio for Performance Marketing's AI-generated workflows, including brand-compliant images and text.

The [!DNL Campaigns] workflow provides: 

* Transparency into campaign goals, brand-aligned content, and designated channels

* Coordination of all assets and experiences that are created or imported into GenStudio for Performance Marketing

* Centralized view of all your organization's campaigns from the [!DNL Campaigns] timeline view

## Campaigns use cases

* [Create a campaign](create-campaign.md). The _Add campaign_ view provides a framework for creating a campaign in GenStudio for Performance Marketing. Information entered in the _Add campaign_ view is saved as a campaign object in [!DNL Campaigns]. 

* [Manage campaigns](manage-campaign.md) and campaign content. Campaign elements such as schedules, ad formats, and stakeholders may evolve during a campaign. You can modify existing campaigns by updating content.

## Campaigns capabilities

[!DNL Campaigns] orchestrates GenStudio for Performance Marketing's generative AI-based capabilities to assist users in planning, creating, coordinating, and measuring campaign performance.

* [[!DNL Create]](/help/user-guide/create/overview.md) provides generative AI-based tools for creating brand-aligned campaign assets. The process of creating new experiences, assets, and asset variants is centralized in the [!DNL Create] Canvas. Your [!DNL Brand] guidelines inform content creation and guide the underlying LLM to conform with your organization's expectations for this campaign. 

* [[!DNL Content]](/help/user-guide/content/overview.md) provides a library of approved assets and experiences that can be included in campaigns. Content is typically generated in GenStudio for Performance Marketing, moves through the review and approval process, and then is saved in [!DNL Content].

* [[!DNL Review and approvals]](/help/user-guide/approvals/overview.md) provides the structure for collaborative review and approval of individual assets and experiences. Stakeholders with different interests and involvement in campaign asset creation--from creatives to legal reviewers--can participate in the process of refining campaign assets.

* [[!DNL Insights]](/help/user-guide/insights/overview.md) captures performance metrics for individual campaign elements and entire campaigns. Marketers can set up metrics to evaluate the campaign's success, such as click-through rates, conversion rates, and engagement levels. Stakeholders can use these metrics to assess the performance of these campaign elements. These insights can fuel creative reworking of assets in [!DNL Create].

* [[!DNL Activate]](/help/user-guide/activation/overview.md) supports publication of campaign assets as ad experiences to their designated channels.
