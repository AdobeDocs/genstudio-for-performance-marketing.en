# Manage Campaigns

The default view of the Campaigns dashboard lists campaigns by **[!UICONTROL Start Date]**, beginning with the most recent. Rows include the core attributes of each campaign. You can toggle between the default list view, card view, and timeline view of all campaigns. Click on the icon representing your preferred view in the upper right of the table.

* **Card view**-This gallery view represents each campaign by a card.
* **Timeline view**-This Gantt-style representation displays each campaign as a horizontal bar that represents its duration and progress. Bars are arranged chronologically from left to right, allowing you to quickly assess campaign progress, spot overlapping milestones, and understand how campaigns align over time.

Each view provides the following capabilities:

* Search for a campaign by name or keyword
* Toggle to change views

### Add and remove campaign content

You can manage assets in a campaign by adding or removing the campaign label from the asset or experience.

1. From the [!DNL Content] _Experiences_ or _Assets_ gallery, select an experience or asset.

1. From the _Details_ view, add or remove the campaign label.

See [!DNL Create] for guidance on creating assets and experiences to include in your campaign.

## Update campaign attributes

As campaigns progress, target audiences and schedules may need adjustment. You can add or remove distribution channels, personas, regions, and products from an active campaign.  

## Add or remove a channel

The campaign's _Details_ view includes the channels, target personas, regions, and products that are linked to this campaign.

   The _Connect Records_ popup opens.
