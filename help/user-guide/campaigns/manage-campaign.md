The Adobe GenStudio for Performance Marketing [!DNL Campaigns] feature accelerates the development and deployment of marketing initiatives, or _campaigns_. The [!DNL Campaigns] workflow enhances the development of campaign assets that lend themselves to creation and management by AI-generated workflows, including brand-compliant images and text. It also provides transparency into campaign goals, brand-aligned content, and designated channels.

Marketing managers use the [!DNL Campaigns] workflow to create a _campaign brief_ that defines campaign features for all stakeholders who are involved in the creation, review, approval, and deployment of [!DNL Campaign] assets.

Define the key elements of your campaign brief in a [!DNL Campaigns] object. This [!DNL Campaigns] object creates a shared context for the campaign assets and experiences that are labeled with the same unique [!DNL Campaigns] label.
