# Brand validation

In GenStudio for Performance Marketing, brand validation is an essential component that works in collaboration with the generative AI functionality and guidelines—[[!DNL Brands]](/help/user-guide/guidelines/brands.md), [[!DNL Products]](/help/user-guide/guidelines/products.md), and [[!DNL Personas]](/help/user-guide/guidelines/personas.md). It ensures that all your content aligns with your brand identity, ADA standards, and individual channel platform guidance.

GenStudio for Performance Marketing conducts brand validation on various aspects, including:

* Defined or default [!DNL Brand], [!DNL Persona], and [!DNL Product] guidelines
* Channel-specific platform guidelines
* Ethical considerations related to gender, ethnicity, race, disability status, and age in AI-generated content
* American with Disabilities Act (ADA) standards

## [!DNL Brand] and accessibility check

A summary of brand validation information for each generated content variant is accessible through the _[!DNL Brand] and accessibility check_ icon for each variant in the Canvas.

The _[!DNL Brand] and accessibility check_ displays the:

* Percentage of compliance with your [[!DNL Brand]](brands.md) calculated as the number of [guidelines](overview.md) that passed validation versus the number of guidelines tested
* `Pass` or `Fail` result for the platform specific guidelines, such as Meta
* `Pass` or `Fail` result for ADA accessibility standards

![[!DNL Brand] and accessibility check](/help/assets/brand-compliance-check.png){width="450" zoomable="yes"}

Click the percentage to see how compliant the variant is. The scores auto-update as you make edits to the variants. You can _View and fix issues_ to ensure further compliancy.

See [Improve brand alignment](#improve-brand-alignment).

## Brand and accessibility check panel

The _Brand and accessibility check_ panel opens on the right side of the Canvas when clicked from the right action bar _or_ from the _Brand and accessibility check_ icon for a variant. This panel provides detailed brand validation and accessibility standards information and illuminates opportunities for improvement for each variant section.

The _Brand and accessibility check_ panel displays validation and [compliance information](/help/user-guide/guidelines/overview.md#compliance) for each section of the variant:

* Representation of the _[!DNL Brand] and accessibility check_ information for [!DNL Brand], platform guidelines, and accessibility standards
* _Failed_ section displaying the number of failed guidelines and detailed information about each guideline needing revision
* _Passed_ section displaying the number of passed guidelines and detailed information about each passing guideline

See [Improve brand alignment](#improve-brand-alignment) to learn how to improve the _Brand and accessibility check_ scores.

### Compliance type

In the _Brand and accessibility check_ panel you can toggle which guideline and accessibility standards checks are performed. Click the _Compliance type_ icon (levels icon) at the top of the panel to toggle on or off:

* **[!DNL Brand]**—Performs the checks associated with [!DNL Brand] guidelines
* **Channel-specific platform**—Performs the checks associated with the channel-specific platform, such as Meta
* **Accessibility**—Performs the checks associated with ADA accessibility standards

To **set the compliance type** for the checks you want performed, click to toggle off or on the available types and click **Apply**.

## Improve brand alignment

To maximize effectiveness of generated content and maintain consistent brand identity, use the [_Brand and accessibility check_](#brand-and-accessibility-check) and the [_Brand and accessibility check_ panel](#brand-and-accessibility-check-panel). You can manually modify specific sections to align with your [[!DNL Brand] guidelines](brands.md), platform guidelines checks, and accessibility standards checks.

**To improve brand alignment for generated variants**:

1. Click the **[!UICONTROL [!DNL Brand] and accessibility check]** icon in the right action bar to see validation and accessibility information for a single variant in the _Brand and accessibility check_ panel.

   You can see a summary of the _Failed_ and _Passed_ checks to see which sections and guidelines need improvement.

   >[!NOTE]
   >
   > The _Brand voice_ guideline noted in the _Brand validation panel_ applies to the entire variant, not an individual section. The whole content variant is highlighted for suggested improvement.

1. Click to fix guidelines that are not currently compliant.
1. Click to expand and inspect each failed check in available sections such as _Headline_ and _Brand voice_.

   Use the reasoning noted for each failed check to inform variant revisions.

1. After making necessary revisions, click **[!UICONTROL Recheck score]** to re-check and validate your changes to ensure they are more closely aligned with your brand identity, platform guidelines, and accessibility standards.

   The brand validation process runs again. If the revised items pass validation, a green banner appears at the bottom of the Canvas to confirm "Brand guideline score was updated". If there was no change after a re-check, the banner confirms "No change to the brand guideline score". The percentage in the _Brand and accessibility check_ icon for the revised variant also shows your progress.

1. Continue revising sections to ensure the entire variant passes validation and accessibility checks. Navigate through each variant using the arrows adjacent to an individual variant in the Canvas.
