# Add guidelines

GenStudio for Performance Marketing allows you to set user-defined guidelines that ensure any AI-generated content is customized to align with a brand identity. This page offers instructions to set and use each specific available guideline. For a general explanation,see the [guidelines overview](/help/user-guide/guidelines/overview.md).

Adding guidelines to GenStudio for Performance Marketing is an important step in the creation process. Guidelines inform the content creation process, along with user-defined prompts, [accessibility and content checks](overview.md#compliance), and Adobe generative AI technology, to craft impactful assets.

Guidelines can be user-defined or exist as default guidelines, such as the [default [!DNL Brand] channel guidelines](/help/user-guide/guidelines/brands.md#default-channel-guidelines).

When creating variants from a template with pre-defined channel guidelines (like [!DNL Brands], [!DNL Personas], or [!DNL Products]) these guidelines apply to the variants. You can change them if desired.

## Add Brands

To add a [!DNL Brand], [upload a brand guide](#upload-a-brand) or [manually create a brand](#manually-add-brand) by selecting guidelines and entering your brand details. [Publish a [!DNL Brand]](#publish-brand) to [!DNL Content] to make it available for use in future content generation.

If you upload brand guidelines written in a non-English language—or manually create a brand using a non-English language—GenStudio for Performance Marketing displays those guidelines in that same language.

In the left navigation area, click **[!DNL Brands]** from the _Shared_ list. In the _[!DNL Brands]_ panel, select **Add brand**.

>[!TIP]
>
>Each brand operates independently with no hierarchical relationships. To create sub-brands under a parent brand, include the parent brand's information during the creation process.

### Upload a brand

You can upload your own brand guidelines documents—up to three PDF or DOC files—to GenStudio for Performance Marketing to automatically create a brand.

   You can attach up to five PDF files for a maximum of 500 MB.

1. Select **[!UICONTROL Add brand]**.

    Using Adobe's generative AI technology, GenStudio for Performance Marketing extracts information from your uploaded documents and begins building your brand. You see brand information, such as brand voice, channel, and image guidelines, populate as each guideline from your brand documents is assembled.

The view for your new brand opens, showing the brand guidelines details extracted from your documents. A popup notifies you _"Your brand is ready to review"_ and reminds you to review the extracted content and make any necessary edits.

**Prerequisites**:

- Organizational access to Adobe Real-Time Customer Data Platform
- Existing audiences already configured in RTCDP sandboxes
- The [!DNL Audience] integration requires a manual onboarding process by the Adobe team 

### Add Audience guidelines

Audiences appear as dropdown in the parameter pane, in the Create workflow.

**To select an audience**:

1. In the Create workflow, select a **[!UICONTROL Persona]**.
1. In the parameters list, click the **[!UICONTROL Audience]** dropdown to view all the available audiences.
1. Select an audience to assign from the list. The system suggests recommended audiences that align with your selected persona.
1. Click **[!UICONTROL See Audience Details]** to view the expanded description and messaging preferences generated for the selected audience. The audience details inform content generation, ensuring your creative aligns with the specific characteristics and preferences of your target segment.
