# Add guidelines

[[!DNL Brands]](/help/user-guide/guidelines/brands.md), [[!DNL Products]](/help/user-guide/guidelines/products.md), and [[!DNL Personas]](/help/user-guide/guidelines/personas.md) are user-defined guidelines in GenStudio for Performance Marketing that ensure any AI-generated content is customized to align with brand identity, enabling effective personalization of content.

See the [guidelines overview](/help/user-guide/guidelines/overview.md).

Adding guidelines to GenStudio for Performance Marketing is an important step in the creation process. Guidelines inform the content creation process, along with user-defined prompts, [accessibility and content checks](overview.md#compliance), and Adobe generative AI technology, to craft impactful assets.

Guidelines can be user-defined or exist as default guidelines, such as the [default [!DNL Brand] channel guidelines](/help/user-guide/guidelines/brands.md#default-channel-guidelines).

## Add Brands

To add a [!DNL Brand], [upload a brand guide](#upload-a-brand) or [manually create a brand](#manually-add-brand) by selecting guidelines and entering your brand details. [Publish a [!DNL Brand]](#publish-brand) to [!DNL Content] to make it available for use in future content generation.

In the left navigation area, click **[!DNL Brands]** from the _Shared_ list. In the _[!DNL Brands]_ panel, select **Add brand**.

>[!TIP]
>
>Each brand operates independently with no hierarchical relationships. To create sub-brands under a parent brand, include the parent brand's information during the creation process.

### Upload a brand

You can upload your own brand guidelines documents—up to three PDF or DOC files—to GenStudio for Performance Marketing to automatically create a brand.

See [[!DNL Brands]](/help/user-guide/guidelines/brands.md).

**To upload brand documents**:

1. Select the **[!UICONTROL Add brand]** button.
1. Choose **[!UICONTROL Upload PDFs]** and enter a brand name in the _Choose a way to add your brand_ popup.

   You can attach up to five PDF files for a maximum of 500 MB.

1. Select **[!UICONTROL Add brand]**.

    Using Adobe's generative AI technology, GenStudio for Performance Marketing extracts information from your uploaded documents and begins building your brand. You see brand information, such as brand voice, channel, and image guidelines, populate as each guideline from your brand documents is assembled.

The view for your new brand opens, showing the brand guidelines details extracted from your documents. A popup notifies you _"Your brand is ready to review"_ and reminds you to review the extracted content and make any necessary edits.

### Manually add brand

You can manually add brand details, instead of uploading existing brand documents, to populate a new [brand](brands.md).
