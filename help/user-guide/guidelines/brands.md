# GenStudio for Performance Marketing [!DNL Brands]

A brand distinguishes an organization, product, service or concept from others. Some aspects of a brand are objective, like a logo, while others are subjective, like tone of voice.

GenStudio for Performance Marketing uses the wealth of brand information from your [!DNL Brand], partners it with [!DNL Product] and [!DNL Persona] information, and builds out a comprehensive brand identity. This brand identity is used to inform the creation of on-brand content using Adobe's generative AI technology.

## Manage Brands

After adding brand guidelines to GenStudio for Performance Marketing, you can [manage](/help/user-guide/guidelines/add-guidelines.md#manage-brands) and [publish](/help/user-guide/guidelines/add-guidelines.md#publish-brand) them. Publishing makes them available for your team to use in asset generation.

[!DNL Brands] can be in either a _Unpublished_ or _Published_ state. New [!DNL Brands] start as _Unpublished_.

You must [publish a [!DNL Brand]](/help/user-guide/guidelines/add-guidelines.md#publish-brand) to make it available for asset generation by your team.

Published brands can be edited (changes are immediately available), duplicated, or unpublished. Only published [!DNL brands] can be used to create and validate content. See [Add guidelines](/help/user-guide/guidelines/add-guidelines.md#manage-brands).

Deleted [!DNL Brands] are archived for 30 days and can be recovered within that period.

## [!DNL Brands] guidelines
