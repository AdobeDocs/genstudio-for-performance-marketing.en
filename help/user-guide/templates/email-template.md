# Prepare a marketing email template for use in GenStudio for Performance Marketing

Typically, a designer creates the visual design of a template in a design program such as Adobe XD. After an email template is designed, coded, and tested, you can prepare it for upload and use in GenStudio for Performance Marketing.

## Add guidelines

Before you prepare a template, ensure that you have added comprehensive [guidelines](/help/user-guide/guidelines/overview.md) to GenStudio for Performance Marketing. Brand, Product, and Persona guidelines directly influence generated content. For example, if you want the body of an email template to be no larger than 500 characters, add that requirement to the [channel guidelines](/help/user-guide/guidelines/brands.md#channel-guidelines) for the "body" field.

If guidelines are not added to GenStudio for Performance Marketing, defaults are used.

## Code an email template

Marketing email templates typically use HTML and inline CSS. The code should be clean and responsive for various devices.

### Multi-section emails


## Define generated content areas

Define the areas in your email template that should be dynamically populated with content from GenStudio for Performance Marketing.

To define generated content areas:

* Identify the text elements in the template that GenStudio for Performance Marketing should auto-generate, such as the headline or CTA.
* Adapt your HTML template by inserting placeholders within it using the Handlebars syntax.

See [Content placeholders](/help/user-guide/content/customize-template.md#content-placeholders).


## Upload and test template

After your template is designed, coded, tested, and previewed, you can upload it to GenStudio for Performance Marketing for use in generating brand new marketing content.
