Selecting the appropriate aspect ratio for your ad is important for maximizing impact and ensuring your content displays correctly across different platforms and placements. Consider the following when choosing an aspect ratio:

- **Campaign objectives**—Define your goals (brand awareness, engagement, conversions) to determine which placements and formats best support them.
- **Platform requirements**—Each paid media channel has recommended aspect ratios for different placements.
- **Content visibility**—Some aspect ratios show more of your creative, while others may crop or resize your content.

Review your campaign goals and placement options before selecting a template. For all templates, keep key visuals and messaging within safe zones to avoid cropping and review platform-specific requirements before finalizing your creative.
