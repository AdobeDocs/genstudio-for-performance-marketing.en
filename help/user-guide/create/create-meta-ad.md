# Create a Meta ad experience

This tutorial demonstrates how to generate branded [Meta ad experiences](/help/user-guide/create/meta-experiences.md) using GenStudio for Performance Marketing [[!DNL Create]](/help/user-guide/create/overview.md) (paintbrush icon in the left navigation area).

Before you begin generating a Meta ad experience, it is important to [incorporate guidelines](/help/user-guide/guidelines/add-guidelines.md) in GenStudio for Performance Marketing and become familiar with the basics of [creating a prompt](/help/user-guide/effective-prompts.md).

## Choose a template

To get started generating a new Meta ad experience, use an available template to provide the framework for your content. See [Meta ad template guidelines](/help/user-guide/templates/meta-template.md) for information about supported Meta ad aspect ratios.

When selecting a template, you have the option of using one of your uploaded templates or a starter template.

**To choose a Meta ad template**:

1. In _[!DNL Create]_, click **[!UICONTROL Meta ads]**.
1. Select **[!UICONTROL Custom templates]** to browse your uploaded templates or **[!UICONTROL Starter templates]** to browse the pre-built templates.

      If you plan to add video assets to your Meta variants, you must choose a starter template. They are preloaded with system-defined content areas that facilitate the use of videos.

1. Click to select a template and click **[!UICONTROL Use]**.

   This action opens the Canvas, which is the central hub for content creation.

## Add parameters

Adding [guidelines](/help/user-guide/guidelines/overview.md) and assets in _Parameters_ in the prompt drawer enhances the content generation process and is a crucial step in preparing to generate a Meta ad.

If you are using a template with pre-defined guidelines---[!DNL Brands], [!DNL Personas], or [!DNL Products]---these guidelines apply to your variants. You can change them if desired.

**To add parameters and assets**:

1. Click the _Parameters_ icon to expand the prompt drawer.
1. In the _Parameters_ section, select guidelines—[!DNL Brands], [!DNL Personas], and [!DNL Products]—to inform content creation.

   ![Choose persona](/help/assets/persona-select.png){width="600" zoomable="yes"}

   If there are no brands, personas, or products available from these menus, [add guidelines to your GenStudio for Performance Marketing](/help/user-guide/guidelines/add-guidelines.md).

1. Add content (images or videos) for use in the experience *and* to influence content generation:
   * Click **[!UICONTROL Select from Content]** to select assets from your [!DNL Content] repository, filter and select one or more images.

      If you are using a template that has a section for videos, video content (.mp4) will be pre-selected and filtered for you. Hover over a video to see an autoplayed preview.

      ![Choose visual content](/help/assets/content-select-meta.png){width="500" zoomable="yes"}

      To use assets from a connected [!DNL AEM Assets Content Hub] repository, choose a repository from the _Location_ dropdown menu. Filter and select one or more images.

   * Or, drag and drop images into the **[!UICONTROL Select from Content]** section to upload one or more new assets.

1. Click **[!UICONTROL Use]**.

When you are done adding parameters, you can collapse the prompt drawer by clicking the _Parameters_ icon again.

## Enter a prompt

After guidelines are selected, craft a prompt using natural language to start generating content for your new Meta ad experience. Detailed prompts yield higher quality output than vague or ambiguous prompts.

See [Write effective prompts](/help/user-guide/effective-prompts.md) to learn more about writing prompts.

**To enter a prompt**:

1. Enter a prompt in the _"Describe the experiences you want to generate"_ prompt box.
1. Click **[!UICONTROL Generate]**.
   
   See [Manage videos](#manage-videos) to understand how they are generated and how to manage them.

By default, four variations—all fueled by the prompt, guidelines, and content you added—are generated and shown in the Canvas.

Generated content loads progressively—as each section of the Meta experiences are generated they appear in the Canvas. See [Meta experiences](/help/user-guide/create/meta-experiences.md#progressive-loading) to learn how those changes are loaded in the Canvas.

## Choose Meta ads channel

When generating a Meta ad, you can choose between Facebook or Instagram ads.

Toggle the Meta ads channel option—between **Facebook** and **Instagram**—in the right menu bar (Facebook and Instagram icons) to see and manage variants for each channel.

When [revising the Meta ads](#revise-generated-variants), you can change the aspect ratio of Facebook and Instagram ads.

## Revise generated variants

Before selecting what to send for approval or publishing to [!DNL Content] you can edit the Meta ads or delete a variant from the set of generated ads.

To highlight an individual layer to revise, click an editable field or image and click _[!UICONTROL View Layers]_.

**To revise generated variants**:

* **To [edit the Meta ad draft name](/help/user-guide/create/manage-variants.md#change-draft-name)**, click into the _Untitled Draft_ title at the top of the Canvas and enter a new title.
* **To [manually edit a Meta ad](/help/user-guide/create/manage-variants.md#manually-edit-text)**, click into any of the ad sections (such as the subject line,

The variants are duplicated and resized.
* **To [regenerate a section of a variant](/help/user-guide/create/manage-variants.md#re-generate-sections)**, click an editable text field and use the _[!UICONTROL Suggested edits]_ options or enter a new prompt and click **[!UICONTROL Generate]**.

Adjust the image to fit the needed aspect ratio and template.
* **To [add alt text for images in a variant](/help/user-guide/create/manage-variants.md#add-alt-text-for-images)**, click an image asset and use the _Alt text_ option to manually add or generate alt text per image.
* **To [add accessibility labels](/help/user-guide/create/manage-variants.md#add-accessibility-labels) to your variants** click on an image or call-to-action link, then provide a brief description that explains what the link or button does.
* **To [delete a Meta ad](/help/user-guide/create/manage-variants.md#delete-variant)**, click the options menu for a variant and click **[!UICONTROL Delete variant]**.

### Manage videos

Hover over each of the videos to see looped autoplay.

Videos are reframed to fit the selected aspect ratio during generation. Revert back to the original non-reframed video by clicking **[!UICONTROL Reframe Video]** and toggling it off.

## Submit generation feedback

To [submit feedback](/help/user-guide/create/manage-variants.md#generation-feedback) about the quality of the generation output, click the options icon (three dots) and select **[!UICONTROL Good output]** or **[!UICONTROL Poor output]**.

## Verify content check alignment

To optimize the generated variants and ensure strict adherence to brand identity, platform guidelines, and accessibility standards, leverage the power of the [_Content check_ panel](/help/user-guide/guidelines/brand-validation.md#content-check-panel). This panel displays comprehensive content check details and illuminates improvement areas.

**To perform content checks on a variant**:

1. Click the _Content check_ panel icon in the right action bar to open the [_Content check_ panel](/help/user-guide/guidelines/brand-validation.md#content-check-panel). View a summary of the *Needs review* and *Passed* checks to see which sections and guidelines need improvement.

   ![_Content check_ panel](/help/assets/content-check-panel.png){height="400" zoomable="yes"}

1. [Manually revise variants](#revise-generated-variants) to ensure your variants are closely aligned with the performed content checks.
