# Figma plugin for GenStudio for Performance Marketing

The GenStudio for Performance Marketing Figma plugin adds a new panel to the Figma application that lets you generate on-brand content.

This page describes how to configure and use the plugin.

Features of this plugin include:

* Map Figma text elements to GenStudio for Performance Marketing fields, such as `headline`, `body`, `on_image_text`, and more.
* Generate new on-brand Meta, LinkedIn, or Display ad [!DNL Experiences] based on a brand, persona, product, and text prompt.
* Create [!DNL Experiences] directly in the Figma document by replacing the text in mapped Figma elements with values generated by GenStudio for Performance Marketing.
* Rephrase, shorten, lengthen, or translate existing content based on a prompt.
* Translate generated [!DNL Experiences] into multiple languages.
* Export generated [!DNL Experiences] to a local source as flattened images.

## Create a template

The plugin requires the first two levels of your Figma document to follow this convention:

* **Section** - This represents the parent project, which can contain multiple templates.
* **Frame** - This represents a template within a project. The template can be filled with text, images, components, and other elements.

### Meta templates

These template sizes are supported:

For Instagram or Facebook posts:

* Width: 1080 px (fixed)
* Height: 1080 px or 1350 px

For Instagram or Facebook stories:

* Width: 1080 px (fixed)
* Height: 1920 px

The plugin decides the chrome of the generated experience based on the height of the template.

### Display templates

There is no fixed size requirement. Display templates support any size.

### LinkedIn templates

* Width: 1200 px (fixed)
* Height: 1200 px, 628 px, 2292 px, 1800 px, or 1500 px

### Field role mapping

The plugin needs to understand the different elements of your template, like headline, body text, or image.

To assign element roles:

1. Select an element in your template (text, image, and so on).
1. Use the dropdown menu to assign a role.

The plugin remembers these mappings to use for generated content. A field role\ can be mapped to multiple template elements.

## Troubleshooting

Consider these best practices and tips if text or images are not being replaced in generated variations.

### Mapped fields

If text or images are not being replaced, check that fields have been mapped to GenStudio field roles in the plugin UI. See [Field role mapping](#field-role-mapping).

### Confirm fonts are available

A text field's font must be available on your machine for replacement to occur during generation. Confirm that all fonts used in the file are available on your machine, especially if the file was created on someone else's machine.

### Consider field role support

Certain channels only support replacement in specific fields. Be aware of exceptions for [field role mapping](#field-role-mapping).
