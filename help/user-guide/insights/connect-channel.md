# Connect channel ad account

The first time you open [!DNL Insights], you may see a banner to guide you to connect Adobe GenStudio for Performance Marketing with a channel account.

This connection enables GenStudio for Performance Marketing to receive statistical data from your active marketing campaigns, media, and ads. Initially, GenStudio for Performance Marketing ingests the last 6 months of data so that you have the tools to analyze the latest data and take action.
