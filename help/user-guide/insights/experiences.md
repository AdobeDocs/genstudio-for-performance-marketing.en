## Experience details

An _experience_ is a promotional asset that includes visual and interactive content intended for distribution to a specific audience as part of a marketing campaign.

Select an experience and view the performance metrics, text attributes, and placements associated with each ad. In the details view, you can analyze an experience's metrics based on its ad placement and marketing efforts within a specified date range.

The details view includes a metrics overall ad `click-through rate`, `cost per action`, and `spend`â€”how much of the budget has been on the ad. Since ads can have multiple placements, such as a feed or a banner, you can see a breakdown of the same metrics for each ad placement. Use the left and right arrows under **[!UICONTROL Performance by ad placement]** to cycle through the placement metrics.

### Text attributes

Below the experience preview is a list of [!UICONTROL Text attributes] associated with the ad. When assets and experiences are approved and stored in [!DNL Content], GenStudio for Performance Marketing generates tags based on their inherent features. See [Asset details](/help/user-guide/content/asset-details.md#system-metadata) for details about system metadata.

## Experience performance

Insights metrics can help you evaluate which experiences contribute to the success of a campaign and which ad placements are most effective.

The following table provides definitions and insights for key digital marketing metrics in the [!UICONTROL Experiences] table view. Each metric includes a brief definition as it relates to ad names, how the metric is calculated, and one or more insights to help understand its significance and impact on an experience.

| Metric                 | Definition                    | Insight                          |
| ---------------------- | ----------------------------- | -------------------------------- |
| **[!UICONTROL Experience name]** | A list of experiences for the connected channel account. Filter ads by selecting a campaign. | Sort the experience list by clicking on any of the key metrics. |
| **[!UICONTROL Campaign]**  | A campaign is a set of experiences designed to achieve a specific objective. | When you filter the Experiences table by campaign, the summary metrics of all experiences for the campaign may be different than the campaign's summary row in the [!UICONTROL Channels] view. This discrepancy can occur if the channel source, such as Meta, and GenStudio use slightly different summary calculations. |
| **[!UICONTROL Placements]** | A count of ad [placements](#ad-placements), locations where an experience appeared in the campaign. | Placements increase audience reach.<p>Ads that show zero placements and zero assets may indicate an [unsupported ad type](#unsupported-placements).</p> |
| **[!UICONTROL Assets]** | The number of assets used in the ad or experience. | The count in the Experiences table may be different than the count in the Experience details view. This discrepancy can occur if the channel source, such as Meta, and GenStudio use slightly different summary calculations. |
| **[!UICONTROL Impressions]** | A count of each time the ad placement or experience loads in the channel, regardless of interaction or viewing. | A high impression count can indicate broad visibility, but for true performance insight, consider it in relation with other engagement metrics. |
| **[!UICONTROL Clicks]**      | The number of times users interact with a clickable element, such as a link or a call-to-action button, in an experience placement. | A high click count indicates strong interest and engagement with the content, which may be effective and reaching the right audience. |
| **[!UICONTROL CTR]**<br>_Click-through rate_ | Percentage (%) of impressions that resulted in clicks on the experience placement within a campaign.<br>**Calculation**: `clicks` divided by `impressions` | A high click-through rate indicates that the content is highly relevant and motivating to the audience in the messaging and design, and is effectively targeting the audience's interests. |
| **[!UICONTROL CPM]**<br>_Cost per thousand_ | Cost for every one thousand ad impressions for the experience placement.<br>**Calculation**: total amount `spent` divided by reach, then multiplied by 1000 | A low value may indicate cost-effective visibility, especially when paired with a high click-through rate. |
| **[!UICONTROL CPA]**<br>_Cost per Action_ | Average cost spent to achieve a specific customer action, such as a purchase or subscription.<br>**Calculation**: total amount `spent` divided by the number of customer actions completed | Use to monitor spending on experiences that result in valuable customer actions. |
| **[!UICONTROL CPC]**<br>_Cost per click_ | Average cost associated with each click in an experience placement.<br>**Calculation**: total amount `spent` divided by `clicks` | Lower average costs may indicate cost-efficient ad spend, especially when compared with a rise in conversions. |
| **[!UICONTROL Spend]**       | The amount spent from the Campaign budget over a given period of time to place this ad Experience. | A high spend amount in a short period may indicate rapid usage, which could lead to early depletion of resources. Track the amount spent against key performance metrics to help monitor the overall return on investment. |
