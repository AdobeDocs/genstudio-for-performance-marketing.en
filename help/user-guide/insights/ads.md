# Ads and ad placement overview

The [!DNL Insights] _[!UICONTROL Ads]_ view shows a list of ads for the connected channel ad account. An _ad_ is a promotional asset that includes visual and interactive content intended for distribution to a specific audience as part of a marketing campaign. For Facebook, the ads are Meta ad names.

The _[!UICONTROL Ads]_ table is organized using [!UICONTROL Ad names]. Click the settings (cog) icon above the right side of the table to toggle the viewable columns. The filter (funnel) icon above the left side of the table opens the **[!UICONTROL Filter]** menu where you can select from multiple lists. Select **[!UICONTROL Clear all]** above the table to remove all filters.

## Ad details

Select an ad and view the performance metrics, text attributes, and placements associated with each ad. The _[!UICONTROL Ad details page]_ includes metrics for the ad `click-through rate`, `cost per action`, and `spend`â€”how much of the budget has been spent on the ad. Since ads can have multiple placements, such as a feed or a banner, you can see a breakdown of the same metrics for each ad placement. Use the left and right arrows under **[!UICONTROL Performance by ad placement]** to cycle through the placement metrics.

## Ad performance

Insights metrics can help you evaluate which ads contribute to the success of a campaign and which ad placements are most effective.

The following table provides definitions and insights for key digital marketing metrics in the [!UICONTROL Ads] table view. Each metric includes a brief definition as it relates to ad names, how the metric is calculated, and one or more insights to help understand its significance and impact on an ad.

| Metric                       | Definition                    | Insight                          |
| ---------------------------- | ----------------------------- | -------------------------------- |
| **[!UICONTROL Ad name]**     | A list of ads for the connected channel account. Filter ads by selecting a campaign. | Sort the ad list by clicking on any of the key metrics. |
| **[!UICONTROL Campaign]**    | A campaign is a set of ads designed to achieve a specific objective. | When you filter the Ads table by campaign, the summary metrics of all ads for the campaign may be different than the campaign's summary row in the [!UICONTROL Channels] view. This discrepancy can occur if the channel source, such as Meta, and GenStudio use slightly different summary calculations. |
| **[!UICONTROL Placements]**  | A count of ad [placements](#ad-placements), locations where an ad appeared in the campaign. | Placements increase audience reach.<p>Ads that show zero placements and zero media may indicate an [unsupported ad type](#unsupported-placements).</p> |
| **[!UICONTROL Media]**       | The number of assets used in the ad and ad placements | The count in the Ads table may be different than the count in the Ad details view. This discrepancy can occur if the channel source, such as Meta, and GenStudio use slightly different summary calculations. |
| **[!UICONTROL Impressions]** | A count of each time the ad placement or ad loads in the channel, regardless of interaction or viewing. | A high impression count can indicate broad visibility, but for true performance insight, consider it in relation with other engagement metrics. |
| **[!UICONTROL Clicks]**      | The number of times users interact with a clickable element, such as a link or a call-to-action button, in an ad placement. | A high click count indicates strong interest and engagement with the content, which may be effective and reaching the right audience. |
| **[!UICONTROL CTR]**<br>_Click-through rate_ | Percentage (%) of impressions that resulted in clicks on the ad within a campaign.<br>**Calculation**: `clicks` divided by `impressions` | A high click-through rate indicates that the content is highly relevant and motivating to the audience in the messaging and design, and is effectively targeting the audience's interests. |
| **[!UICONTROL CPM]**<br>_Cost per thousand_ | Cost for every one thousand ad impressions.<br>**Calculation**: total amount `spent` divided by reach, then multiplied by 1000 | A low value may indicate cost-effective visibility, especially when paired with a high click-through rate. |
| **[!UICONTROL CPA]**<br>_Cost per Action_ | Average cost spent to achieve a specific customer action, such as a purchase or subscription.<br>**Calculation**: total amount `spent` divided by the number of customer actions completed | Use to monitor spending on ads that result in valuable customer actions. |
| **[!UICONTROL CPC]**<br>_Cost per click_ | Average cost associated with each click in an ad placement.<br>**Calculation**: total amount `spent` divided by `clicks` | Lower average costs may indicate cost-efficient ad spend, especially when compared with a rise in conversions. |
| **[!UICONTROL Spend]**       | The amount spent from the Campaign budget over a given period of time to place this ad. | A high spend amount in a short period may indicate rapid usage, which could lead to early depletion of resources. Track the amount spent against key performance metrics to help monitor the overall return on investment. |
| **Attributes**               | List of inherent features present in this ad. | Can help identify creative elements that resonate most with your audience. See [Categories](/help/user-guide/insights/attributes.md#categories). |
