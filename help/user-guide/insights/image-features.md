# Image features

Image features represent distinct and informative elements or patterns within an image that are used for analysis with [!DNL Insights]. These features help in categorizing and understanding the visual content, enabling more accurate and detailed insights. By identifying various attributes, such as style, color, and objects, the AI can provide a comprehensive analysis of the image, aiding in better decision-making and strategy formulation.

## Style detection

Determining the _image style_ serves as a foundation for identifying other image characteristics. The AI can apply the appropriate analysis techniques and recognize relevant features, leading to a more comprehensive understanding of the image. Each style has distinct visual characteristics that influence how the image is perceived and analyzed.

If the image style is identified as a `photograph`, the AI analyzes additional traits for `camera settings`, `camera proximity`, and `Photography genres`. These traits are specific to photographs and provide deeper insights into the image's composition and quality. See [28 types of photography styles](https://www.adobe.com/creativecloud/photography/discover/types-of-photography.html) in Adobe's _Learn photography_ and learn about popular types of photography and foundational terminology.

If the image style is identified as a `sketch` or a `digital cartoon`, a different set of characteristics may be relevant. This hierarchical approach ensures that the analysis is contextually accurate and tailored to the specific type of image being examined.

## Search image features

**To view images in a specific attribute category**:

1. In _[!DNL Insights]_, select the **[!UICONTROL Attributes]** view.

1. Change the table view by selecting **[!UICONTROL Images]**.

1. Select an image feature from the **[!UICONTROL Attribute category]** list, such as `Scenes`.

1. Select an attribute for a detailed view of images that share that category.

   As an example, the `Scenes` category may have `restaurant` as an attribute.

1. The _Attribute details_ page lists all the images with this attribute.

The following table lists the image feature categories recognized by the GenStudio for Performance Marketing AI. The detected attributes list for media content is not exhaustive. Media that contains a rich set of features may be limited to the three most dominant features identified by the AI.

| Category                | Description                                                                                           | Example                                                                                                                                                                        |
| ----------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Attention distribution  | The level of viewer attention spread across an image, indicating how much focus different areas of the image may receive. A higher distribution means that no single area dominates the viewer's focus, while a lower distribution means that one or two focal points capture the viewer's attention.  | `high`, `medium`, `low`<p>Example of `low` distribution on the left and `high` distribution on the right:<p>![low and high-distribution ball play](/help/assets/category/image-attn-lowhigh.png "Difference in low and high distribution"){width="200" zoomable="yes"} |
| Camera angle            | The perspective from which the camera captures the subject, which affects the viewer's perception and interpretation of the image. If the Image style is `photograph`, then this trait is identified. | `Low angle`, `High angle`, `Eye level`, `Neutral angle`, `Overhead view`, `Bird's eye view`<p>Example of `Overhead view`:<p>![Overhead view](/help/assets/category/image-camera-angle.png "Pair of shorts from overhead"){width="200" zoomable="yes"}                                                                                         |
