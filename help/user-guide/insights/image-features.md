| Category                | Description                                                                                           | Example                                                                                                                                                                        |
| ----------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Attention distribution  | The level of viewer attention spread across an image, indicating how much focus different areas of the image may receive. A higher distribution means that no single area dominates the viewer's focus, while a lower distribution means that one or two focal points capture the viewer's attention.  | `high`, `medium`, `low`<p>Example of `low` distribution on the left and `high` distribution on the right:<p>![low and high-distribution ball play](/help/assets/category/image-attn-lowhigh.png "Difference in low and high distribution"){width="100" zoomable="yes"} |
| Camera angle            | The perspective from which the camera captures the subject, which affects the viewer's perception and interpretation of the image.  | `Low angle`, `High angle`, `Eye level`, `Overhead view`, `Dutch angle`, `Bird's eye view`<p>Example of `eye level`:<p>![eye level](/help/assets/category/image-camera-angle.png "People sitting at different angles"){width="200" zoomable="yes"}                                                                                         |
| Camera setting          | The specific adjustments and configurations of the camera's controls that influence the final appearance and quality of the image. | `Fast shutter speed`, `Long exposure`, `Bokeh blur`, `Motion blur`, `Tilt-shift blur`, `Flash`, `Wide-angle`, `Black and white`, `Surreal`, `Double-exposure`, `Macro`, `Normal mode` |
| Color and tone          | The colors and tonal qualities within an image. Identifies up to three colors from a predefined set of 40 colors in different image layers:<p>**[!UICONTROL Foreground colors]**—colors in the front layer of the image<br>**[!UICONTROL Background colors]**—colors in the back layer of the image | Color values: `Red`, `Dark Red`, `Green`, `Bright Green`, `Dark Green`, `Light Green`, `Mud Green`, `Blue`, `Dark Blue`, `Light Blue`, `Royal Blue`, `Black`, `White`, `Off White`, `Gray`, `Dark Gray`, `Silver`, `Cream`, `Magenta`, `Cyan`, `Yellow`, `Mustard`, `Khaki`, `Brown`, `Dark Brown`, `Violet`, `Pink`, `Dark Pink`, `Maroon`, `Tan`, `Purple`, `Lavender`, `Turquoise`, `Plum`, `Gold`, `Emerald`, `Orange`, `Beige`, `Lilac`, `Olive` |
| Color temperature       | Describes the general warmth or coolness of colors in the image.                                          | Tone or temperature values: `warm`, `cool`, `neutral`<br>![colors and cool tones](/help/assets/category/image-color-temp.png "Color temperature with cool background and multiple colored objects"){width="200" zoomable="yes"} |
| Content density         | The concentration of visual elements and details within an image, indicating how much information is packed into the visual space.<p>Unlike attention distribution, which measures how viewer focus is spread across different areas of an image, content density focuses on the quantity of visual information present. A higher content density means that more elements are present. | `high`, `medium`, `low`<p>Example of `low` density on the left and `high` density on the right:<p>![low and high-density ball play](/help/assets/category/image-attn-lowhigh.png "Difference in low and high content density"){width="100" zoomable="yes"} |
| Image style             | The visual treatment of an image, such as a photograph or sketch. Once the AI determines the image style, other traits may be identified. For example, if the image is a photograph, then camera settings, camera proximity, and lighting conditions may apply.   | `Photograph`, `Sketch`, `Painting`, `Digital cartoon`, `Infographics`, `Graphic design`, `Collage`, `Software screenshot`<p>![cartoon image style](/help/assets/category/image-style.png "Image style cartoon of a cat"){width="200" zoomable="yes"}       |

| Objects                 | Identifies one or more items, entities, and elements that make up the image.                              | Values are too numerous, but some examples include: `backpack`, `book`, `hawk`, `glasses`, `fish`, `pencil`, `mountain bike`, `soap`<p>Example of objects `toucan` and `bird`:<p>![bird, toucan object](/help/assets/category/image-objects-bird.png "Graphic design of Toucan bird object"){width="200" zoomable="yes"}                                                                        |
| Orientation             | The alignment of the image in relation to its width and height. Detects whether it is wider than it is tall (landscape), taller than it is wide (portrait), or equal in width and height (square). | `landscape`, `portrait`, `square`<p>![square sketch](/help/assets/category/image-orientation-square.png "Square orientation flower sketch"){width="200" zoomable="yes"} |

| Subject distance        | The distance between the camera and the subject of an image.                                              | `close up`, `mid shot`, `long shot`<p>Example of `closeup shot`<p>![close-up shot](/help/assets/category/image-subject-distance.png "Close up flower and jeweled bee"){width="200" zoomable="yes"}                                           |

| Tags                    | Detects other image characteristics that do not fall under a specific classification. Tags provide additional context and metadata about the image.
