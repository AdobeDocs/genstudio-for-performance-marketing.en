# Activate Amazon Ads

Adobe GenStudio for Performance Marketing enables GenStudio system managers and editors to publish ad experiences to the Amazon Ads platform.

You can initiate publication of a Amazon Ads ad experience from either the Content gallery or Activate home.

## Step 1: Set up your Amazon Ads accounts

Amazon Ads allows marketers to organize campaigns and ads within different accounts. Each account includes a creative library. GenStudio for Performance Marketing publishes ad experiences into a creative library.

Before attempting an activation, [log in to your Amazon Ads account][1]. Confirm that you have access to Amazon Ads advertisers. When you publish an Amazon Ads experience from GenStudio for Performance Marketing, it's delivered to the ad account selected during creation.

## Step 2: Connect to your Amazon Ads accounts

Before your organization can publish assets in a creative library, a GenStudio system manager must connect your Amazon Ads accounts to GenStudio for Performance Marketing. This user must have admin access to the advertiser to read and write into Amazon Ads. See [Connect paid media accounts][2].

After the sync is complete, you can view the added accounts.

## Step 3: Select content for your ad experience

You can start the publication process from either the Content Experiences gallery or the Activate home. Approved experiences cannot be edited. Each experience can contain only one asset.

To select experiences:
