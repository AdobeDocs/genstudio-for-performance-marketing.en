# Troubleshooting

Activating an ad experience involves assembling your experience in Adobe GenStudio for Performance Marketing _[!DNL Activate]_, but also connecting with the paid channel ad manager.

Errors may occur during the activation process. These errors are typically encountered during these two activation phases:

* Preparing your experience for activation
* Publishing your experience to its designated paid channel ad managers
