# Create an activation

The _[!DNL Activate]_ feature supports the activation of ad experiences in channel-specific formats. Although each paid channel is defined by unique placement requirements, all ad activations share the same high-level steps.

## What is an ad experience?

A GenStudio for Performance Marketing experience is a marketing campaign component, such as an ad, that is tailored to a specific audience on a paid ad channel. Ad experiences contain three main components:

* **Media assets**: Media assets are the images (GIFs, PNG, JPEG) included in your ad experience. Activation currently supports static images.
* **Text**: Text comprises all forms of copy that are included in your ad -- headlines, body text, and call-to-action elements.
* **Metadata**: User-defined attributes that you can assign to content. Metadata enhances performance analysis, filtering, and tracking. It is typically not visible to users. 

Creating an activation involves refining each of these ad components for a designated channel placement and marketing campaign. GenStudio for Performance Marketing supports activating one experience to one paid channel.

## Activation workflow

Activating an experience to any paid channel has three core phases:

**Connect GenStudio for Performance Marketing to your target channel**. Connecting your channel accounts to GenStudio for Performance Marketing is a prerequisite to activation.
 
**Prepare your experience for activation**. Preparation includes selecting the media assets in the appropriate aspect ratio for your specific ad placement and assigning text to call-to-action elements and body copy. You can also add informative metadata that aids users in searching for the experience after activation. Each ad channel placement specifies valid aspect ratios for visual assets included in the placement. 

**Review and publish your experience to the target channel**.  Use the _Preview_ panel in the _[!DNL Create]_ activation workflow to assess your choice of ad placement and text elements before finalizing your activation. Your final pre-publication review occurs in the destination channel's ad management app. For example, after activating a Meta ad experience in GenStudio for Performance Marketing, you must log into Meta Ads Manager, review your ad experience, then select its specific attributes before publishing it.

Once an experience is live on its target ad channel, _[!DNL Insights]_ can track and analyze its performance data.
