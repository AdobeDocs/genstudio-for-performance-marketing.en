# Create an activation

The _Activate_ feature supports the activation of ad experiences in channel-specific formats. Although each paid channel is defined by unique placement requirements,  all ad activations share the same high-level steps.

## What is an ad experience?

A GenStudio for Performance Marketing experience is a marketing campaign component, such as an ad, that is tailored to a specific audience on paid ad channel. Ad experiences contain three main components:

* **Media assets** – Media assets are the images (GIFs, PNG, JPEG) included in your ad experience. Activation currently supports static images.
* **Text** – Text comprises all forms of copy that is included in your ad -- headlines, body text, and call-to-action elements.
* **Metadata** –  User-defined attributes that you can assign to content. Metadata enhances performance analysis, filtering, and tracking. It is typically not visible to users. 

Creating an activation involves refining each of these ad components for a designated channel placement and campaign. GenStudio for Performance Marketing supports activating one experience to one paid channel.

## Activation workflow

Activating an experience to any paid channel has three core phases:

**Connect GenStudio for Performance Marketing to your target channel**. You must set up accounts on the channel before you can activate your ad. A connection to each channel must be set up on a per organization level, too.
 
**Prepare your experience for activation**. These preparations include selecting the media assets in the appropriate aspect ratio for your specific ad placement, assigning text to ad call-to-action elements and body copy, and adding informative metadata that aids users in searching for the experience after activation. Each ad channel placement specifies valid aspect ratios for visual assets included in the placement.

**Review and publish your experience to the target channel**. GenStudio for Performance Marketing provides a preview panel to assess ad dsiplay features, (especially the asset aspect ratios that are specific to each ad placement option), but your final pre-publication review should occur in the destination channel's ad management app  For example, after activating a Meta ad experience in GenStudio for Performance Marketing, you must log into Meta Ads Manager, review your ad experience one last time, then publish to its designated channel and placement.

Once an experience is live on its target ad channel, Insights can track and analyze its performance data.
