# Adobe GenStudio for Performance Marketing Activate

GenStudio for Performance Marketing _[!DNL Activate]_ provides a central location for preparing your ad experience for activation to select paid ad channels. _Activation_ is the process of making an ad experience available for delivery to designated channels and Adobe Experience Cloud products. Once delivered from GenStudio for Performance Marketing to the specified ad channel management service, such as Meta Ads Manager, experiences can then be distributed in their intended markets.

Content editors and system managers can publish experiences whose assets are either generated in or uploaded into GenStudio for Performance Marketing.

[!DNL Activate] displays a product tile for each channel. This tile identifies the paid media channel, lists the number of successful ad activations that has occurred in the past 30 days, and provides an entry point for managing activations and creating a new activation.

An existing connection to paid media channel accounts must be set up before you can activate an experience.
