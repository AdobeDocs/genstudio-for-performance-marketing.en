# Adobe GenStudio for Performance Marketing Activate

GenStudio for Performance Marketing [!DNL Activate] provides a central location for preparing your ad experience for activation to select paid ad channels. _Activation_ is the process of preparing ad experiences, assets, and text as a creative ad experience uniquely tailored for placement in a specific paid channel. Activation delivers the creative experience to designated channels in an inactive state, ready for final review and deployment from the channel. Ad experiences can then be distributed in their intended markets.

Content editors and system managers can publish experiences whose assets are either generated in or uploaded into GenStudio for Performance Marketing.

[!DNL Activate] displays a product card for each supported paid media channel. This tile identifies the paid media channel and lists the number of successful ad activations that have occurred in the past 30 days. It also provides an entry point for managing activations and creating a new activation.

Each paid media channel accounts must be connected to GenStudio for Performance Marketing before you can activate an ad experience.

## Activate use cases

* Activate approved experiences directly from [!DNL Content] for select paid ad channels.

* [Create an activation](create-activation.md). You can craft an ad experience by selecting visual assets, assigning text, and defining metadata before pushing to a paid channel.

* [Manage activations](manage-activations.md). _[!DNL Activate]_ provides an overview of all activated experiences. You can also view the details of individual activations.

## Activate capabilities

[!DNL Activate] facilitates the preparation of ad experiences for distribution to their target paid channels.

### Activate an approved experience directly from Content

You can activate an approved experience directly from [!DNL Content], or activate multiple approved experiences as an activation group for select paid channels. All experiences in a group must target the same paid channel.

### Prepare an experience for activation

The _Experience setup_ page consolidates the tools that you need to select the visual elements of an ad experience, tweak ad text (including call-to-action text), and add helpful metadata that enhances experience tracking and visibility.

### Select assets for ad experience

Search for and select approved visual assets from [!DNL Content], or upload assets from Dropbox or OneDrive. You can upload assets directly from your device. One ad experience can run in multiple placements. Assets can be uploaded in the aspect ratios your ad placements require.

### Preview and activate your experience to an ad channel

Confirm the paid channel accounts, ad sets, and Meta campaigns associated with this ad activation. The _Preview_ panel lets you view ad experiences in different placements before you finalize it. (When you select a placement in the _Preview_ panel, only your view of the ad is affected. Your placement selection in the _Preview_ panel is not saved.) When you are satisfied with your ad experience, click **[!UICONTROL Publish]** to push the experience and its associated metadata to the paid ad channel.
