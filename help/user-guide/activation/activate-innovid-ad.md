# Activate an Innovid ad

Adobe GenStudio for Performance Marketing enables GenStudio system managers and editors to publish ad experiences to the Innovid platform.

Initiate the publication of an Innovid ad experience from either the Content gallery or Activate home.

## Step 1: Set up your Innovid accounts

Innovid allows marketers to organize campaigns and ads within different accounts. Each advertiser has a creative library, and GenStudio for Performance Marketing publishes ad experiences into a creative library.

Before attempting an activation, [log in to your Innovid account][1]. Confirm that you have access to Innovid accounts. When you publish an Innovid experience from GenStudio for Performance Marketing, it's delivered to the creative library that was selected during creation.

## Step 2: Connect to your Innovid accounts

Before your organization can publish assets in a creative library, a GenStudio system manager must connect your Innovid accounts to GenStudio for Performance Marketing. You must have admin access to the added account to read and write into Innovid. See [Connect paid media accounts][2].

After the sync is complete, you can view the added accounts.

## Step 3: Select content for your ad experience

Start the publication process from either the Content Experiences gallery or the Activate home. Approved experiences cannot be edited. Each experience can contain only one asset.

To select experiences:

1. Use the Content gallery's search and filter tools to identify the experience you want to activate. Then click **[!UICONTROL Use]**. Alternatively, you can select an experience from Activate by clicking **[!UICONTROL New]** on the Innovid product card.
2. You'll be prompted to select a platform before continuing with activation. Select *Innovid*. The Innovid Experience setup page opens for this experience. It's pre-populated with the experience's details and cannot be revised. 
3. (Optional) Click **[!UICONTROL Add experience]** to add experiences to this activation group.
4. Click **[!UICONTROL Next]** to confirm your Innovid platform setup. The **[!UICONTROL Platform setup]** view opens.This view shows options derived from your configured Innovid accounts.

## Step 4: Confirm Innovid platform setup

1. Select an account from the **[!UICONTROL Account]** drop-down menu. 
1. Select a Creative Library from the **[!UICONTROL Creative Library]** drop down. Your Innovid account settings determine the Creative Libraries available. Your creative experience is delivered to this Creative Library in Innovid when activation is complete.
2. Add a name to the **[!UICONTROL Creative name]** field. Innovid identifies the experience by this name.
3. Repeat for each selected experience.
4. Click **[!UICONTROL Next]** to confirm your Innovid setup.

## Step 5: Preview and activate your ad   

The Review page provides a final opportunity to review your activation before publishing.

1. (Optional) Click **[!UICONTROL Edit section]** next to the **[!UICONTROL Platform setup]** label to edit the platform setup. You cannot edit experience content.
1. Click **[!UICONTROL Publish]**.

Your Innovid ad experiences are pushed directly to the creative library within the selected Innovid account.

## Step 6: Complete publication of your ad experience

Visit [Innovid's website][1] to manage the final steps of setup and to deploy your ad within the published experience.
