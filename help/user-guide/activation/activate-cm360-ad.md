# Activate a Google Campaign Manager 360 ad

Adobe GenStudio for Performance Marketing enables GenStudio system managers and editors to publish ad creatives to the Google Campaign Manager 360 platform. 

You can initiate publication of a Google Campaign Manager 360 ad experience from either the _[!DNL Content]_ gallery or _[!DNL Activate]_ home.

## Step 1: Set up your Google Campaign Manager 360 accounts

Before launching an activation, [log in to your Google Campaign Manager 360 account](https://campaignmanager.google.com). Confirm that you have access to Google Campaign Manager 360 advertisers. When you publish a Campaign Manager 360 creative from GenStudio for Performance Marketing, it is delivered to the advertiser selected during creation.

Campaign Manager 360 allows marketers to organize campaigns and their components into structured units called _advertisers_. Each advertiser includes a creative library. GenStudio for Performance Marketing publishes ad experience, or creatives, into a creative library.

## Step 2: Connect to your Google Campaign Manager 360 accounts

Before your organization can activate experiences, a GenStudio system manager needs to connect your Google Campaign Manager 360 accounts to GenStudio for Performance Marketing. This connection allows data to flow between GenStudio for Performance Marketing and external marketing tools such as Google Campaign Manager 360, enabling the activation process. See [Connect paid media accounts](/help/user-guide/connectors/connect-channel.md).

After the sync is complete, you can view the added accounts. Large amounts of data take longer to sync.

## Step 3: Choose content for your creative

You can start the publication process from either the _[!DNL Content]_ Experiences gallery or the _[!DNL Activate]_ home. Approved experiences cannot be edited. Each experience can contain only one asset.

**To select an experience**:

1. Use the _[!DNL Content]_ gallery's search and filter tools to identify the experience you want to activate, then click **[!UICONTROL Activate]**. (Alternatively, you can select an experience from _[!DNL Activate]_ by clicking **[!UICONTROL New]** on the Google Campaign Manager 360 product card.)

   The Google Campaign Manager 360 _Creative setup_ page opens for this experience. It is pre-populated with details, which you cannot revise, from the selected experience.

1. Select an advertiser from the **[!UICONTROL Advertiser]** drop-down menu.

   Your Google Campaign Manager 360 account settings determine the available advertisers.

1. After selecting your advertiser, click **[!UICONTROL Next]** to confirm your Google Campaign Manager 360 setup.

1. Assign a name to your experience. After activation, you can use this name to search for this experience in the _Activated experiences_ table.

## Step 4: Confirm Google Campaign Manager 360 account setup

After selecting your ad experience, you must confirm the Google Campaign Manager 360 account advertiser and assign a tracking ID to the creative. The Google Campaign Manager 360 account view is populated with options that are derived from the configured Google Campaign Manager 360 accounts.

### Tracking ID

The creative name serves as a tracking ID, enabling the collection of performance metrics. Enter the creative name in the _Creative name_ field.

Click **[!UICONTROL Next]** in the upper right to preview your ad experience and finalize activation.

## Step 5: Preview and activate your ad

The _Review_ page provides a final opportunity to view your ad experience before publishing.

If you launched this activation from _[!DNL Activate]_, you can click **[!UICONTROL Edit section]** next to the _Creative setup_ label to make your changes. You can also click **[!UICONTROL Back]** in the upper right to return to the _Creative setup_ page. Experiences directly selected from Content cannot be edited.

## Step 6: Complete publication of your ad experience

1. Click **[!UICONTROL Publish]**.

   The complete Campaign Manager 360 ad experience is pushed directly to the creative library within the selected Campaign Manager 360 advertiser.

1. [Log in to your Google Campaign Manager 360 account](https://campaignmanager.google.com) to manage the final steps of set up and deploying youe ad within the published creative.
