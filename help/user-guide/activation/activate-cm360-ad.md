# Activate a Google Campaign Manager 360 ad

Adobe GenStudio for Performance Marketing enables GenStudio system managers and editors to publish ad experiences to the Google Campaign Manager 360 platform.

You can initiate publication of a Google Campaign Manager 360 ad experience from either the [!DNL Content] gallery or [!DNL Activate] home.

## Step 1: Set up your Google Campaign Manager 360 accounts

Before launching an activation, [log in to your Google Campaign Manager 360 account](https://campaignmanager.google.com). Confirm that you have access to Google Campaign Manager 360 advertisers. When you publish a Campaign Manager 360 experience from GenStudio for Performance Marketing, it is delivered to the advertiser library selected during creation.

Campaign Manager 360 allows marketers to organize campaigns and ads within different _advertisers_. Each advertiser includes a creative library. GenStudio for Performance Marketing publishes ad experiences into a creative library.

## Step 2: Connect to your Google Campaign Manager 360 accounts

Before your organization can publish assets in a creative library, a GenStudio system manager must connect your Google Campaign Manager 360 accounts to GenStudio for Performance Marketing. This user must have admin access to the advertiser to read and write into Campaign Manager 360. See [Connect paid media accounts](/help/user-guide/connectors/connect-channel.md).

After the sync is complete, you can view the added accounts.

## Step 3: Select content for your ad experience

You can start the publication process from either the _[!DNL Content]_ Experiences gallery or the _[!DNL Activate]_ home. Approved experiences cannot be edited. Each experience can contain only one asset.

**To select experiences**:

1. Use the [!DNL Content] gallery's search and filter tools to identify the experience you want to activate, then click **[!UICONTROL Use]**. (Alternatively, you can select an experience from [!DNL Activate] by clicking **[!UICONTROL New]** on the Google Campaign Manager 360 product card.)

   The Google Campaign Manager 360 _Experience setup_ page opens for this experience. It is pre-populated with the experience's details, which you cannot revise. You may be asked to select a platform before continuing with activation.

1. (Optional) Click **[!UICONTROL Add experience]** to add experiences to this activation group.

1. Click **[!UICONTROL Next]** to confirm your Google Campaign Manager 360 platform setup.
   The _Platform setup_ view opens. This view is populated with options that are derived from your configured Google Campaign Manager 360 accounts.

## Step 4: Confirm Google Campaign Manager 360 platform setup

1. Select an advertiser from the **[!UICONTROL Advertiser]** drop-down menu. Your Campaign Manager 360 account settings determine the available advertisers.

   Your creative experience is delivered to this advertiser library in Google Campaign Manager 360 when activation is complete.

1. Add a name to the **[!UICONTROL Creative name]** field. Google Campaign Manager 360 identifies the experience by this name.
   Repeat for each selected experience.

1. Click **[!UICONTROL Next]** to confirm your Google Campaign Manager 360 setup.

## Step 5: Preview and activate your ad

The _Review_ page provides a final opportunity to review your activation before publishing.

1. (Optional) Click **[!UICONTROL Edit section]** next to the _Platform setup_ label to edit the platform setup. You cannot edit experience content.

1. Click **[!UICONTROL Publish]**.
   Your Campaign Manager 360 ad experiences are pushed directly to the creative library within the selected Campaign Manager 360 advertiser.

## Step 6: Complete publication of your ad experience

1. [Log in to your Google Campaign Manager 360 account](https://campaignmanager.google.com) to manage the final steps of setup and deploying your ad within the published experience.
