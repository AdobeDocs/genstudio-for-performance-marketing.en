# Activate a Google Campaign Manager 360 ad

Adobe GenStudio for Performance Marketing enables GenStudio system managers and editors to publish ad experiences to the Google Campaign Manager 360 platform. 

You can initiate publication of a Google Campaign Manager 360 ad experience from either the _[!DNL Content]_ gallery or _[!DNL Activate]_ home.

## Step 1: Set up your Google Campaign Manager 360 accounts

Before launching an activation, [log in to your Google Campaign Manager 360 account](https://campaignmanager.google.com). Confirm that you have access to Google Campaign Manager 360 advertisers. When you publish a Campaign Manager 360 experience from GenStudio for Performance Marketing, it is delivered to the advertiser account selected during creation.

Campaign Manager 360 allows marketers to organize campaigns and ads within different _advertisers_. Each advertiser includes a creative library. GenStudio for Performance Marketing publishes ad experiences into a creative library.

## Step 2: Connect to your Google Campaign Manager 360 accounts

Before your organization can publish assets in a creative library, a GenStudio system manager must connect your Google Campaign Manager 360 accounts to GenStudio for Performance Marketing. This user must have admin access to the advertiser to read and write into Campaign Manager 360. See [Connect paid media accounts](/help/user-guide/connectors/connect-channel.md).

After the sync is complete, you can view the added accounts.

## Step 3: Choose content for your ad experience

You can start the publication process from either the _[!DNL Content]_ Experiences gallery or the _[!DNL Activate]_ home. Approved experiences cannot be edited. Each experience can contain only one asset.

**To select an experience**:

1. Use the _[!DNL Content]_ gallery's search and filter tools to identify the experience you want to activate, then click **[!UICONTROL Activate]**. (Alternatively, you can select an experience from _[!DNL Activate]_ by clicking **[!UICONTROL New]** on the Google Campaign Manager 360 product card.)

   The Google Campaign Manager 360 _Experience setup_ page opens for this experience. It is pre-populated with details, which you cannot revise, from the selected experience.

1. Select an advertiser from the **[!UICONTROL Advertiser]** drop-down menu.

   Your Google Campaign Manager 360 account settings determine the available advertisers.

1. After selecting your advertiser, click **[!UICONTROL Next]** to confirm your Google Campaign Manager 360 setup.

1. Assign a name to your experience. After activation, you can use this name to search for this experience in the _Activated experiences_ table.

## Step 4: Confirm Google Campaign Manager 360 account setup

After selecting your ad experience, you must confirm the Google Campaign Manager 360 account advertiser to publish the asset to. The Google Campaign Manager 360 account view is populated with options that are derived from the configured Google Campaign Manager 360 accounts.

### Tracking ID

The experience name is also known as a _tracking ID_ in GenStudio for Performance Marketing. Tracking enables the collection of performance metrics. Enter the experience name in the _Experience name_ field.

Click **[!UICONTROL Next]** in the upper right to preview your ad experience and finalize activation.

## Step 5: Preview and activate your ad

The _Review_ page provides a final opportunity to view your ad experience before publishing.

If you launched this activation from _[!DNL Activate]_, you can click **[!UICONTROL Edit section]** next to the _Experience setup_ label to make your changes. You can also click **[!UICONTROL Back]** in the upper right to return to the _Experience setup_ page. You cannot edit experience content.

## Step 6: Complete publication of your ad experience

1. Click **[!UICONTROL Publish]**.

   The complete Campaign Manager 360 ad experience is pushed directly to the creative library within the selected Campaign Manager 360 advertiser.

1. [Log in to your Google Campaign Manager 360 account](https://campaignmanager.google.com) to manage the final steps of set up and deploying your ad within the published experience.
