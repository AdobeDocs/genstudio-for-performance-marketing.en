# Manage activations

[!DNL Activate] offers a centralized view of each ad channel's activation status, including Published (successful), Failed (unsuccessful), and Publishing (pending) activations. The _Activated Experiences_ view displays all activations for one connected channel ad account.

[!DNL Activate] organizes activated experiences by ad channel. Click **[!UICONTROL View]** on the channel tile. The _Activated experiences_ view for the selected channel opens. This view lists experiences by name and orders them by activation date. If your organization has not activated experiences for that channel, the product tile does not include the **[!UICONTROL View]** button.

## Activated experience view

This view lists activations by experience name in descending chronological order (most recent listed first).

The following table lists the attributes that define each experience.

| Attribute        | Value                                                                                       |
|------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|

| Ad name          | Name of the ad in the ad channel                                                           |
| Publish date     | Date that the ad experience was successfully published<br>Uses month-day-year format         |

| Regions          | Geographic region in which the experience is launched     |

Use **[!UICONTROL Search]** (magnifying glass) or scroll the experience list to find an activation by experience name.

Click on the activation to open a focused view of activation details.

## Details view

From the _Activated experiences_ view, click on an activation. The read-only _Activation details_ view captures the defining details of an activated experience, including failed activations. This view includes information derived from both GenStudio for Performance Marketing and the ad channel.

* **Publication time and date**: Time and date of publication from the ad channel manager
* **Ad ID**: ID assigned by the paid channel and used for tracking. Click the **[!UICONTROL Open]** button adjacent to this field to view the published ad in Meta Ads Manager
* **Experience details**: The selected image assets, texts, and metadata assigned during the GenStudio for Performance Marketing activation workflow
* **Channel setup**: The paid channel accounts used to activate the ad experience

The _Details_ view of a failed activation includes the reason for failure.
