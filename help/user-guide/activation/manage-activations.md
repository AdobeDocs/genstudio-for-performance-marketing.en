# Manage activations

_[!DNL Activate]_  offers a centralized view of each ad channel's activation status, including Published (successful), Failed (unsuccessful), and Publishing (pending) activations. The _Activated Experiences_ view displays all activations for one connected channel ad account.

Activated experiences are organized by ad channel. From _[!DNL Activate]_, click **[!UICONTROL View]** on the channel tile. The _Activated experiences_ view for the selected channel opens. Experiences are listed by experience name and ordered by activation date. If your organization has not activated experiences for that channel, the product tile does not include the **[!UICONTROL View]** button.

### Activated experience view

Activations are listed by experience name in descending chronological order (most recent listed first).

The following table lists the attributes that define each experience.

| Attribute        | Value                                                                                       |
|------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Experience name  | Name of the experience in GenStudio for Performance Marketing. This name identifies the experience in _[!DNL Content]_ |
| Ad name          | Name of the ad in the ad channel                                                           |
| Publish date     | Date that the ad experience was successfully published. Uses month-day-year format         |

Click on the activation opens a focused view of activation details.
