# Manage activations

Adobe GenStudio for Performance Marketing _[!DNL Activate]_  offers a centralized view of each ad channel's activation status, including successful, unsuccessful, and pending activations. The _Activated Experiences_ view displays all activations for the connected channel ad account.

From the _Activated experiences_ view, you can:

* View all activated experiences by channel
* View details for individual experiences

## View activated experiences

Activated experiences are organized by ad channel.

**To view activations for a specific channel**:

From _[!DNL Activate]_, click **[!UICONTROL Manage]** on the channel tile. The _Activated experiences_ view for the selected channel opens. Experiences are listed by experience name and ordered by activation date. If your organization has not activated experiences for that channel, the product tile does not include a **[!UICONTROL View]** option.
