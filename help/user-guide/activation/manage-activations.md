# Manage activations

Adobe GenStudio for Performance Marketing _[!DNL Activate]_  offers a centralized view of each ad channel's activation status, including successful, unsuccessful, and pending activations. The _Activated Experiences_ view displays all activations for one connected channel ad account.

From the _Activated experiences_ view, you can:

* View activated experiences by channel
* View details of individual activations

## View activated experiences

Activated experiences are organized by ad channel.

**To view activations for a specific channel**:

From _[!DNL Activate]_, click **[!UICONTROL Manage]** on the channel tile. The _Activated experiences_ view for the selected channel opens. Experiences are listed by experience name and ordered by activation date. If your organization has not activated experiences for that channel, the product tile does not include a **[!UICONTROL View]** option.

### Activated experiences table

The following table lists the attributes that define each experience.

| Attribute        | Value                                                                                       |

**To view experience details**:

From the _Activated experiences_ view, click on an activation. If needed, use **[!UICONTROL Search]** (magnifying glass) or scroll the experience list to find an activation by experience name. Clicking on an experience displays a view of the activated experience.

The read-only _Activation details_ view captures the defining details of an activated experience after it has been published to its paid channel. This view includes information derived from both GenStudio for Performance Marketing and the ad channel.
