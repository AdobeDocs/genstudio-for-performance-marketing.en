# Get started with Adobe GenStudio for Performance Marketing

Adobe GenStudio for Performance Marketing offers a comprehensive suite of tools designed to streamline content creation, management, and analysis.

If you are new to generative AI-based tools or are simply curious about GenStudio for Performance Marketing's core principles, see [Concepts](concepts.md) and [Write effective prompts](effective-prompts.md).

## Train GenStudio for Performance Marketing

GenStudio for Performance Marketing need information about your brand and markets in order to optimally enhance brand-compliant content creation. Training materials include examples, descriptions of customer [personas](/help/user-guide/guidelines/personas.md) and [products](/help/user-guide/guidelines/products.md), and [brand guidelines](/help/user-guide/guidelines/overview.md).

System managers set up Adobe GenStudio for Performance Marketing by entering or uploading organization-specific information. This preparation ensures that content editors and collaborators can effectively use the generative AI features to create and review campaign assets. Once an Adobe system administrator has provisioned your organization's product instance and assigned GenStudio system manager permissions, a GenStudio system manager can prepare the product's underlying generative AI framework by either manually entering or uploading your organization's specific brand requirements.

### Step 1: Add guidelines

Setting up the key building blocks of your organization's brand identity is an essential prerequisite for the work of content editors and collaborators. [Guidelines](./guidelines/overview) capture brand characteristics such as logos, tone of voice, and color palettes. You can either upload [[!DNL Brands] guidelines](./guidelines/brands) documents or manually enter brand information. [[!DNL Personas] guidelines](./guidelines/personas) and [[!DNL Products] guidelines](./guidelines/products) are important, too. GenStudio for Performance Marketing's underlying generative AI capabilities use these guidelines to establish guardrails that guide the content generation.

#### Prepare your guideline documents

Comprehensive, focused [[!DNL Brands]](./guidelines/brands), [[!DNL Products]](./guidelines/products), and [[!DNL Personas]](./guidelines/personas) guidelines define core aspects of your organization's marketing campaigns. GenStudio for Performance Marketing extracts information from these guidelines to begin building your brand.

Follow these best practices when preparing guidelines:

* Use specific as possible in language and specification.

* Include the best examples you can find of the style and tone you want campaign assets to embody.

* Avoid redundancy. You might be tempted to repeat a directive multiple times, but redundancy in your guidlines does not help the underlying LLM capture and implement your brand guidelines.

* Identify elements you want the LLM to exclude during content generation (for example, exclamation points in text)

You can upload guideline documents or consult them as you manually enter information into GenStudio for Performance Marketing. See [Add guidelines](./guidelines/overview.md) for guidance on uploading or entering this information.

#### Revise guidelines

Once an Adobe system administrator provisions your organization's product instance and assigns permissions, a GenStudio for Performance Marketing system manager can prepare the product's underlying generative AI framework by manually entering or uploading your organization's specific brand requirements.
Although setting up an organization's brand guidelines can be a one-time action, you might need to revise and enhance these guidelines based on your organization's volatility, growth, and changing market circumstances.

### Step 2: Upload templates

Templates accelerate content creation. A template contains approved features, such as headers and footers, and are optimized for specific channels. System managers typically upload and manage templates for their organization. Content editors use templates to jumpstart the content creation process within the established boundaries of the organizational brand.

See [Work with templates](./content/use-templates.md) for directions on customizing and uploading templates.

### Step 3: Upload approved assets

Approved assets in [!DNL Content] are available to all GenStudio for Performance Marketing editors. You can populate [!DNL Content] with assets for content editors to use in creating new experiences or assets. See [Upload approved assets](./content/manage-assets.md) for guidance on uploading and managing assets.

### Step 4: Connect to a Meta (Facebook) account

Configure a connection between GenStudio for Performance Marketing and your organization's social accounts to receive data from your active marketing campaigns, assets, and experiences. [[!DNL Insights]](./insights/overview.md) provides tools to analyze channel-derived data. See [Connect to a Meta (Facebook) account](./insights/connect-channel.md).
