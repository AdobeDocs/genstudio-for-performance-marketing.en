# Prepare Adobe GenStudio for Performance Marketing to generate content

GenStudio system managers prepare their organization's Adobe GenStudio for Performance Marketing environment for content editors and collaborators to create campaign assets. These preliminary set-up tasks focus on either manually entering or uploading the organization-specific information that GenStudio for Performance Marketing's generative AI capabilities can use to support content creation. These steps include:

1. [Add guidelines](./guidelines/overview.md) for [!DNL Brands], [!DNL Products], and [!DNL Personas]. Setting up the key building blocks of your organization's brand identity is an essential prerequisite for the work of creators and collaborators. You can either upload brand guideline documents or manually enter brand information.
   * **Prepare your guidelines documents**. The more descriptive and comprehensive your brand guidelines, the better the output. Include brief examples of features that you consider essential to your brand and add descriptions of behavior you want to exclude from content creation. GenStudio for Performance Marketing extracts information from these uploaded documents and begins building your brand. Information such as brand voice, channel, and image guidelines, are populated as GenStudio for Performance Marketing assembles each guideline from your uploaded documents.
   * **Edit or complete brand guideline fields as needed**. Comprehensive brand guidelines form the basis of GenStudio for Performance Marketing's understanding of your organization's brand. Once GenStudio for Performance Marketing has extracted the information it needs from your brand guideline documents, you are prompted to manually edit or complete fields of extracted information. Specify individual product focus areas for content creation by adding a [!DNL Product]. [!DNL Personas] guidelines help tailor content creation for defined customer segments.

   Although setting up an organization's brand guidelines can be a one-time action, you might need to revise and enhance these guidelines based on your organization's volatility, growth, and changing market circumstances.

1. **[Upload templates](./content/use-templates.md)**. Templates provide shortcuts and accelerate content creation. A template contains approved features, such as headers and footers, and establishes guardrails for content creation. System managers typically upload and manage templates for their organization. Creators use templates to jumpstart the content creation process within the established boundaries of the organizational brand.

1. **[Upload approved assets](./content/manage-assets.md)**. Approved assets in [!DNL Content] are available to all GenStudio for Performance Marketing creators. You can seed [!DNL Content] with assets that creators can use to create new experiences or assets. 

1. **[Connect to a Meta (Facebook) account](./insights/connect-channel.md)**. Configure a connection between GenStudio for Performance Marketing and your organization's social accounts to receive data from your active marketing campaigns, assets, and experiences. [[!DNL Insights]](./insights/overview.md) provides tools to analyze channel-derived data.
