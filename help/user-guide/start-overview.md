# Get started with Adobe GenStudio for Performance Marketing

Adobe GenStudio for Performance Marketing is a comprehensive platform for creating, evaluating, and managing marketing experiences that reflect and adhere to your brand identity. Stakeholder access to its many capabilities is controlled by assigned _user roles_. Your assigned user role determines the tasks that you can perform within GenStudio for Performance Marketing.

Onboarding users to your organization's deployment of GenStudio for Performance Marketing and assigning the most appropriate permissions -- provisioning users -- is an essential prerquisite to your organization deploying the product and starting collaboration.

Once product and user provisioning is completed, a Genstudio system manager can set up your organization's brand and media guidelines.

## Basic onboarding tasks overview

The following set-up tasks must be completed before your organization can collaborate using GenStudio for Performance Marketing:  

* Provision the product and users

* Set up your organization's brand and media guidelines using product's underlying generative AI framework

## Provision the GenStudio for Performance Marketing product and users

_Product provisioning_ is the one-time setup of your organization's GenStudio for Performance Marketing instance. An Adobe system administrator performs these initial provisioning tasks in the Adobe Admin Console. From this Console, the Adobe system admin can access the GenStudio product profile and start the process of assigning available licenses to users that belong to the IMS org that is specified in the product profile.

Adding individual users to your organization's GenStudio instance is _user provisioning_, or onboarding. The number of users you can assign roles to is determined by the number of licenses your organization purchases. _User provisioning_ is an essential start-up task, but also occurs as users join or leave your organization. An Adobe system administrator creates user accounts and permissions in the GenStudio for Performance Marketing product profile in the Adobe Admin Console. User accounts can be added manually or imported in bulk. Central to effective management of user accounts is understanding [GenStudio user roles](GS-user-roles.md).

[Adobe system admins](https://helpx.adobe.com/enterprise/using/admin-roles.html) carry out provisioning tasks in the [Adobe Admin Console](https://helpx.adobe.com/enterprise/using/admin-console.html).

See [Provisioning the Adobe GenStudio for Performance Marketing product and users](GS-product-provisioning.md) for details.

### Set up your organization's brand and media guidelines overview

Once an Adobe system admin has provisioned your organization's product instance, and one or more users have been assigned GenStudio system managers permissions, a GenStudio system manager can prepare the product's underlying generative AI framework by either manually entering or uploading your organization's specific brand requirements. A GenStudio system manager performs these initial set-up tasks.

If you have been assigned GenStudio system manager privileges and are ready to perform initial set-up tasks, see [Prepare GenStudio for Performance Marketing to generate content](get-started.md).

## GenStudio for Performance Marketing user roles overview

Creating and deploying modern marketing campaigns requires collaboration among stakeholders with varying responsibilities and skill sets.

Three types of GenStudio for Performance Marketing user roles support this diversity of organizational roles. Permissions are tailored to each of these user types and support each user's responsibilities in the marketing organization. These three user roles are:

* **Editors** use GenStudio for Performance Marketing's generative AI capabilities to create marketing campaign assets, request content review and approval, and publish approved drafts of this content. All GenStudio for Performance Marketing users can access and use an asset once its editor has saved it to [!DNL Content].

* **Collaborators** are the widest range of GenStudio for Performance Marketing users. Collaborators can view and approve content and are an essential part of the workflow that ensures that the content you generate matches your organization's needs and standards.

* **System managers** have the broadest set of permissions within GenStudio for Performance Marketing. System managers perform the essential onboarding task of establishing the fundamental guardrails for campaign asset creation and deployment. System managers implement these guardrails by uploading brand and organizational-specific information such as [brand guidelines](/help/user-guide/guidelines/overview.md). GenStudio system managers have permission to create and publish brands, but have no user administration privileges. All user administration occurs in the Adobe Admin Console.

[GenStudio for Performance Marketing user roles](GS-user-roles.md) details the specific entitlements that each user role grants.

>[!NOTE]
>Before any users are provisioned into these roles, an Adobe system administrator must be designated in the Adobe Admin Console to perform one-time setup tasks. This Adobe admin role operates only in the context of the Adobe Admin Console. It has no role in the GenStudio for Performance Marketing platform interface. An Adobe system administrator who needs system manager entitlements in GenStudio must provision themselves as a Genstudio system manager in the Adobe Admin Console.
